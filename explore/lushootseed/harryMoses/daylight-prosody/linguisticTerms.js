**DC**: diminished control causative _-dxʷ_

Another frequent valency-increasing suffix is _-dxʷ_. This causative
transitive affix is added to intransitive stems and, like -t and -txʷ,
adds an AGENT/subject to the expression. However, in _-dxʷ_ forms the
AGENT is in less than complete control of the situation.

ADNM: adjunctive nominalizer

(from David Beck's DRAFT Grammar)

7.4.2.2 dəxʷ=nominals

The second nominalizing proclitic, dəxʷ=, is used primarily for the
nominalization of adjunct and circumstantial expressions, particularly
(but not exclusively), instruments, locations, motivations, and
manners, and will be referred to here as an adjunctive
nominalizer. Like s=nominals, dəxʷ= creates nominal expressions with
the same distribution as relative and headless relative clauses. The
following examples illustrate adjunctive nominals referring to
instruments in the syntactic roles of predicate complement (519a) and
relative clause (519b):

519:

      - a. gwəl diɬ dəxʷšəɬtəbiɬədtubs
           gwəl diɬ dəxʷ=šəɬ–təbiɬəd–txʷ–b=s
           then FOC ADNM=make–rope–ECS–PASS=3PO
           ‘then these were made into rope’
           (Hess 1998: 80, line 81)

      - b. kwədad tiʔəʔ qwuʔ dəxʷuc’agwačiʔbs ʔə tiʔəʔ sbaɬs
           kwəda–d tiʔəʔ qwuʔ dəxʷ=ʔu–c’agw–ačiʔ–b=s
           taken–ICS PROX water ADNM=PFV–wash–hand–MD=3PO PR PROX NM=cure=3PO
           ‘he took some water that he washed his hands with for the curing ceremony’143
           (Hess 1998: 57, line 36) 

The examples in (520) show adjunctive nominals expressing locations,
used as an argument and the object of a preposition, respectively:

520:

      - a. hay gwəl ɬuhuyutəbəxʷ č’it tiʔiɬ dəxʷʔibəš čəɬ
           hay gwəl ɬu=huyu–t–əb=əxʷ č’it tiʔiɬ  dəxʷ=ʔibəš čəɬ
           INTJ then IRR=be.done–ICS–PASS=now nearby DIST ADNM=travel 1PL.PO 
           ‘and then where we are traveling [to] will be made near’
           (Hess 1995: 147, line 10)

      - b. hay gwəl bəɬčiləxʷ dxʷʔal tiʔiɬ bədəxʷɬčils
          hay gwəl bə=ɬčil=əxʷ dxʷ–ʔal tiʔiɬ bə=dəxʷ=ɬčil=s
          INTJ then ADD=arrive=now CNTRPT–at DIST ADD=ADNM=arrive=3PO 
          ‘and then he arrived at where he arrived’
          (Hess 1998: 66, line 22)

These last two types of adjunctive nominals are the most noun-like in
the sense that their referents are physical entities (objects and
locations). However, dəxʷ= is also used to form a wide variety of
other expressions, one of the most common being expressions of motive:

(521)

     - a. sɬild čəɬ ti dəgwi tiʔiɬ dəxʷuwiliq’wid čəɬ
          s=ɬil–d čəɬ ti dəgwi tiʔiɬ dəxʷ=ʔu–wiliq’wi–d čəɬ
          NM=give.food–ICS 1PL.PO SPEC you DIST ADNM=question–ICS 1PL.PO 
          ‘the reason that we questioned you [is] that we are giving you this food’144
          (Hess 1998: 80, line 69)

     - b. ʔa tiʔiɬ adəxʷx̌əɬ, x̌ənimulicaʔ
          ʔa tiʔiɬ ad=dəxʷ=x̌əɬ x̌ənimulicaʔ
          be.there DIST 2SG.PO=ADNM=sick x̌ənimulicaʔ
          ‘there is a reason that you are sick, x̌ənimulicaʔ’
           (Hess 1998: 57, line 26)

In both of these sentences, the adjunctive nominal serves as the syntactic subject.
Another type of adjunctive nominal expresses manner:

(522)

      - a. gwəl diɬ tiʔəʔ cəxʷkwədxʷ tiʔəʔ dsʔəɬəd
           gwəl diɬ tiʔəʔ d=dəxʷ=kwəd–dxʷ tiʔəʔ d=s=ʔəɬəd
           then FOC PROX 1SG.PO=ADNM=take–DC PROX 1SG.PO=NM=eat
           ‘than how I managed to get my food was that [way]’
           (Hess 1998: 83, line 164)

      - b. hay, diɬ dəxʷhuyuds ʔušəbabdxʷ tsiʔə ʔalš ʔə tiʔəʔ suʔəɬadəps
           hay diɬ dəxʷ=huyu–d=s ʔušəbabdxʷ tsiʔə ʔalš ʔə tiʔəʔ s=ʔu–ʔəɬadəp=s
           INTJ FOC ADNM=be.done–ICS=3PO poor.dear PROX:FEM cross.sex.sibling PR PROX NM=PFV–give.feast=3PO
           ‘so, that is how he made his sister poor when she gave a feast’
           (Hess 1998: 63, line 66)

In the first sentence here, the clausal nominal serves as the
syntactic subject of the copula diɬ, while in the second it serves as
the complement of the same element (see Sections 8.2.5 and 11.2 below
for discussion of these structures).  A less commonly-attested use of
adjunctive nominals is to indicate purpose:

(523)

      - a. huˑy, huyudəxʷ tiʔiɬ sxə̌ ɬ dxʷʔal kwi dəxʷx̌əɬ ʔə tsiʔəʔ ʔalšs
           huy huyu–d–əxʷ tiʔiɬ s–x̌əɬ ʔə tsiʔəʔ ʔalš–s
          INTJ be.done–ICS–now DIST NP–sickPR PROX:FEM cross.sex.sibling–3PO
          ‘then he made a sickness so his sister got sick’

      - b. ɬuacəxʷɬčiltxʷ dxʷʔal kwsi adčəgwas ʔi kwi adbədbədaʔ
           ɬu=ad=dəxʷ=ɬčil–txʷ dxʷ–ʔal kwsi ʔi kwi ad–bəd–bədaʔ
           IRR=2SG.PO=ADNM–arrive–ECS CNTRPT–at REM:FEM 2SG.PO–wifeand REM 2SG.PO–DSTR–offspring
          ‘[you will pack it] so that you can bring it to your wife and children’
           (Hess 1998: 86, line 237)

In such expressions, the adjunctive nominal is accompanied by the
preposition dxʷʔal, whose meaning ‘towards, motion to’ undoubtedly
contributes to the purposive reading. Even less frequent are
adjunctive nominals that have a temporal reading:

(524)

      - hay, gwəl, diɬəxʷ tudəxʷkwədatəbsəxʷ tiʔəʔ cədiɬ č’ətx̌
        hay gwəl diɬ=əxʷ tu=dəxʷ=kwəda–t–əb=s=əxʷ tiʔəʔ cədiɬ č’ətx̌
        INTJ then FOC=now PAST=ADNM=take–ICS–PASS=3PO=now PROX he kingfisher
        ‘well and then that is when they [almost] caught Kingfisher
        (Hess 2006: 20, line 207)

The temporal aspect of such expressions may be as much as artefact of
translation as the semantics of the expression (cf. the alternate
translations as locatives “ ... where they caught Kingfisher,”
“... the point at which they caught Kingfisher”). Alternatively, the
few uses of dəxʷ= in temporal contexts may represent a metaphorical
extension from the more common locative spatial usage into time. There
are no more than a handful of such expression in the texts and so the
temporal uses of adjunctive nominals appears to be a marginal function
at best.

<p>

wikipedia: The subjunctive (also known as conjunctive in some languages) is a
grammatical mood, a feature of an utterance that indicates the
speaker's attitude toward it. Subjunctive forms of verbs are typically
used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion,
possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet
occurred; the precise situations in which they are used vary from
language to language. The subjunctive is one of the irrealis moods,
which refer to what is not necessarily real. It is often contrasted
with the indicative, a realis mood which principally indicates that
something is a statement of fact.

<p>
The subjunctive indicates the speaker's attitude toward the irrealis
state or action's existance: imagined? wished for? possible? not yet
occurred?

<p>

Used when questioning, denying, or doubting.  With nouns, speakers
often omit it because <b>kʷi</b> expresses much the same idea.  With
verbs, some speakers usually omit <b>kʷi</b>, others tend to omit
<b>gʷ-</b>.

<br>
<h5>Examples</h5>

  <li> _gʷəʔux̌ʷ_  sbj=go              (were to go)
</ul>

<p>
The irrealis <b>ɬu</b> and the subjunctive <b>gʷ-</b> have a somewhat
similar meaning from the English speaker's perspective.  On occasion
they are both glossed as *might*.  However, <b>gʷ-</b> marks a situation
as doubtful (when not simply contrary to fact) whereas <b>ɬu-/</b> imparts
the idea of expectation.

#####Lexical Suffix

<ul>

   <li> Lexical affixes (or semantic affixes) are bound elements that appear as affixes, but
      function as 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(linguistics)" target="_blank">incorporated nouns</a> 
      within verbs and as elements of nouns. They are similar
      to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although
      similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as
      freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.
   <li> Lexical affixes are relatively rare. The Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages all 
      have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest
      of North America.  The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance
      to free nouns with similar meanings.
   <li> In this sense, they are unlike what is usually perceived as derivational affixes, which
      more often have little concrete meaning, rather serving to identify lexical classes.
   <li> Lexical suffixes have gone by several names. Sapir described them, rather than naming them, and
      called them ''verbal affixes that refer to nouns" (1911:251/1989 [1990]:28);
   <li> Reichard called them "nominal suffixes" (1938:601),
   <li> Vogt used the term "field-suffixes" (1940:58), and Kuipers divided them into "somatic suffixes"
      (1967:120) and "non-somatic suffixes" (1967:125).
   <li> The usage "1exical suffixes" was first used by Kinkade (1963:352), adopted from Vogt, who used this
      term, rather, for "a group of suffixes which modify the verb, by changing its
      syntactical functions or by adding various shades of meaning, as iteration,
      reciprocity, reflexivity etc."  (1940:56).
   <li> Kinkade made the change because of the semantic similarity between these suffixes and usual lexical
      items (i.e. nouns). The term is now in  general use in discussing this class of affix in Salish,
      Chemakuan, and Wakashan studies.
   <li> A small number of prefixes found in some Salishan languages are often referred to as
      "lexical prefixes", probably developed by analogy with lexical suffixes; I will not deal with
      these prefixes here.

"Clitic":
`
#####Clitic

A clitic is a morpheme that has syntactic
characteristics of a word, but depends phonologically
on another word or phrase. In this sense, it is
syntactically independent but phonologically
dependent—always attached to a host. A clitic is
pronounced like an affix, but plays a syntactic role at
the phrase level. In other words, clitics have the form
of affixes, but the distribution of function words. For
example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in
I'm and we've are clitics.
<h5>Summary</h5>

Clitics can be defined as <i>prosodically defective
function words</i>. They can belong to a number of
syntactic categories, such as articles, pronouns,
prepositions, complementizers, negative adverbs, or
auxiliaries. They do not generally belong to open
classes, like verbs, nouns, or adjectives. Their
prosodically defective character is most often
manifested by the absence of stress, which in turn
correlates with vowel reduction in those languages that
have it independently; sometimes the clitic can be just
a consonant or a consonant cluster, with no vowel. This
same prosodically defective character forces them to
attach either to the word that follows them (proclisis)
or to the word that precedes them (enclisis); in some
cases they even appear inside a word (mesoclisis or
endoclisis). The word to which a clitic attaches is
called the host. In some languages (like some dialects
of Italian or Catalan) enclitics can surface as
stressed, but the presence of stress can be argued to
be the result of assignment of stress to the
host-clitic complex, not to the clitic itself. One
consequence of clitics being prosodically defective is
that they cannot be the sole element of an utterance,
for instance as an answer to some question; they need
to always appear with a host.

 <p><p>

A useful distinction is that between simple clitics and
special clitics. Simple clitics often have a nonclitic
variant and appear in the expected syntactic position
for nonclitics of their syntactic category. Much more
attention has been paid in the literature to special
clitics. Special clitics appear in a designated
position within the clause or within the noun phrase
(or determiner phrase). In several languages certain
clitics must appear in second position, within the
clause, as in most South Slavic languages, or within
the noun phrase, as in Kwakw'ala. The pronominal
clitics of Romance languages or Greek must have the
verb as a host and appear in a position different from
the full noun phrase. A much debated question is
whether the position of special clitics is the result
of syntactic movement, or whether other factors,
morphological or phonological, intervene as well or are
the sole motivation for their position. Clitics can
also cluster, with some languages allowing only
sequences of two clitics, and other languages allowing
longer sequences. Here one relevant question is what
determines the order of the clitics, with the main
avenues of analysis being approaches based on syntactic
movement, approaches based on the types of
morphosyntactic features each clitic has, and
approaches based on templates. An additional issue
concerning clitic clusters is the incompatibility
between specific clitics when combined and the changes
that this incompatibility can provoke in the form of
one or more of the clitics. Combinations of identical
or nearly identical clitics are often disallowed, and
the constraint known as the Person-Case Constraint
(PCC) disallows combinations of clitics with a first or
second person accusative clitic (a direct object, DO,
clitic) and a third person (and sometimes also first or
second person) dative clitic (an indirect object, IO,
clitic). In all these cases either one of the clitics
surfaces with the form of another clitic or one of the
clitics does not surface; sometimes there is no
possible output. Here again both syntactic and
morphological approaches have been proposed.

"Tense-aspect-mood (TAM)":

`
#####Tense-aspect-mood (TAM)
A group of grammatical categories which are important for the understanding of
spoken or written content and which are marked in different ways by different languages.
   
- Tense: location of state or action in time, past, present or future.
- Aspect: extension time, whether it is unitary (perfective), continuous or repeated (imperfective).
- <a href="#Mood">Mood</a> its reality: actual (realis), a possibility,  or a necessity (irrealis).
  &mdash; from Medieval Latin irrealis,  in- (“not”) + realis (“actual; existing”)

Subjunctive

The subjunctive indicates the speaker's attitude toward the <i>irrealis</i> state or
action's existance: imagined? wished for?  possible?  not yet occurred?

The irrealis subjunctive contrasts with the realis moods, whose most common form is the
 <i>indicative</i>, indicating actual or high probability events or states.

Other realis moods: evidential, mirative (surprise).

Subjunctive forms of verbs are typically
used to express various states of <i>unreality</i> such as: wish,
emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that
has not yet occurred; the precise situations in which they are used
vary from language to language. The subjunctive is one of the
<i>irrealis</i> moods, which refer to what is not necessarily real. It
is often contrasted with the <i>indicative</i>, a realis mood which is
used principally to indicate that something is a statement of fact.

In a sentence, the grammatical mood conveys the speaker’s attitude
about the state of being of what the sentence describes. This may
sound a little complicated, but it’s simple enough: In the indicative
mood, for instance, the speaker is sure that something is the case,
while in the imperative mood the speaker desires that something should
happen.

In English, the subjunctive mood is used to explore conditional or
imaginary situations. It can be tricky to use, which partially
explains why many speakers and writers forgo it.

Also: 
- aspect: how an action, event, or state, denoted by a verb, extends over time
- mood: the speaker's attitude toward what they are saying (for example, a 
statement of fact, of desire, of command, etc.)

"Adjunct":
`
#####Adjunct

An optional, or structurally dispensable part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that, 
if removed or discarded, will not structurally affect the remainder of the sentence. 

In the sentence <i>John helped Bill in Central Park</i>, the phrase 
<i>in Central Park</i> is an adjunct.

An adjunct can be a single word, a phrase, or an entire clause:

- She will leave <i>tomorrow.</i>
- She will leave <i>in the morning.</i>
- She will leave <i>after she has had breakfast.</i>
`,

"Inchoative":
`
#####Inchohative

Inchoative (or inceptive) indicates a process of beginning or
becoming.  Abbreviated INCH.

Most of the Interior Salish languages have an
important affix which has been called INCHOATIVE. Semantically it
covers both simple mutative ideas—i.e., shift to a new state of
affairs—and more specialized notions emphasizing the beginning of
an action or state or the emergence of a concept.

Inchoative aspect is a grammatical aspect, referring to the
beginning of a state. It can be found in conservative
Indo-European languages such as Latin and Lithuanian, and also in
Finnic languages or European derived languages with high
percentage of Latin-based words like Esperanto. It should not be
confused with the prospective, which denotes actions that are
about to start. The English language can approximate the
inchoative aspect through the verbs "to become" or "to get"
combined with an adjective.

Inchoative is a term used for verbs whose meanings can be
paraphrased as '<i>to begin to...</i>' (e.g. inflame and depopulate) or
verbs which express the beginning of a state or process, like
<i>harden</i> (become hard), <i>die</i> (become dead) or break. The term is also
used in explicating the ambiguity of <i>John will eat his lunch in an
hour</i>: the inchoative reading is the one in which it will take an
hour before John is to eat his lunch.

"Derivation vs. Inflection":
`
#####Derivation vs. Inflection

Derivation can be contrasted with inflection, in that derivation
can produce a new word (a distinct lexeme) whereas inflection
produces grammatical variants of the same word.


Ad hoc criterion: a derived word earns it's own entry in a
dictionary, as in <i>bake</i>, <i>baker</i>, <i>bakery</i>
vs. <i>bake</i>, <i>baked</i>, <i>baking</i>.

Inflection applies in more or less regular patterns to all
members of a part of speech (for example, nearly every English
verb adds <i>-s</i> for the third person singular present tense),
while derivation follows less consistent patterns (for example,
the nominalizing suffix <i>-ity</i> can be used with the
adjectives <i>modern</i> and <i>dense</i>, but not with open or
strong). However, it is important to note that derivations and
inflections can share homonyms, that being, morphemes that have
the same sound, but not the same meaning. For example, when the
affix <i>-er</i>, is added to an adjective, as in <i>small-er</i>,
it acts as an inflection, but when added to a verb, as in
<i>cook-er</i>, it acts as a derivation.


As mentioned above, a derivation can produce a new word (or new
part of speech) but is not required to do so. For example, the
derivation of the word "common" to "uncommon" is a derivational
morpheme but doesn't change the part of speech (adjective).

An important distinction between derivational and inflectional
morphology lies in the content/function of a listeme. Derivational
morphology changes both the meaning and the content of a listeme,
while inflectional morphology doesn't change the meaning, but
changes the function.

 listeme is a word or phrase (or, according to Steven Pinker,
"a stretch of sound") that must be memorized because its sound or
meaning does not conform to some general rule. Also called a
lexical item. All word roots, irregular forms, and idioms are
listemes.

- -able
- im-
- un-
- -ing
- -er

"Additive Style":
`
#####Additive Style
Stanley Fish, How to Write a Sentence, and How to Read One (2011): 

<blockquote>I want to submit to you that topic sentences and thesis statements 
are best expressed in the subordinating style rather than in the additive style.
</blockquote>

The first of Walter Ong's characteristics of orally based thought
and expression, chapter 3 of Orality and Literacy, "Some Psychodynamics of Orality",
p.37.  He compares the creation narrative in Genesis 1:1-5,
King James Version 1604-1611

- In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
- And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. 
- And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
- And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
- And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
- And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. 
- And the evening and the morning were the first day.

New American Bible 1970

- In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth,
the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters.
- Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
- God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness.
- God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." Thus evening came, and morning followed - the first day.

"Habitual":
`
#####Habitual:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_aspect" target="_top">wikipedia</a>: 
the aspect of a verb is a grammatical category that defines
the <b>temporal flow</b> (or lack thereof) in a given action, event, or
state. 

<p> While habituals "describe a situation which is characteristic of an
extended period of time" (Comrie 1985: 27), iteratives consist of "repeated
occurrences of the same situation".

<p>The habitual aspect (abbreviated HAB) is not to be confused with iterative 
aspect or frequentative aspect, specifies an action as occurring habitually: the 
subject performs the action usually, ordinarily, or customarily. As such, the 
habitual aspect provides structural information on the nature of the subject referent:
<ul> 
   <li> "John smokes" being interpretable as "John is a smoker"
   <li> "Enjoh habitually gets up early in the morning" as "Enjoh is an early bird". 
</ul>

Some sense of intrinsic, inborn is carried: an event or state is characteristic of a period of time.

 <p>
 <b>iterative aspect</b>: or event-internal pluractionality, expresses the repetition
 of an event observable on a single occasion.  <i>she is drumming</i>
 <b>frequentive aspect</b>: like habitual, this implies multiple occasions.  
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentative" target="_top">wikipedia</a>
  describes English <i>-le</i> and <i>-er</i> as frequentive suffixes, (grunt -> gruntle, jig -> jiggle)
   and reduplication (i.e. <i>murmur</i>) and vowel grades (i.e, <i>teeter-totter</i> and <i>pitter-patter</i>).
 English present tense often has a frequentive aspect: <i>I walk to work</i>.  
 <p>

 The habitual aspect is a type of imperfective aspect, which does not depict an event as 
 a single entity viewed only as a whole but instead specifies something about its internal
 temporal structure.
 <p>

The habitual aspect is a form of expression connoting repetition or continuous existence of a state of 
affairs. In standard English, present tense, there is no special grammatical marker for the habitual; 
the simple present is used, as in <i>I go there (every day)</i>.

<p> However, for past reference English uses the simple past form or either of two alternative
markers: <b>used to</b> as in <i>we used to go there (every Thursday)</i>, and <b>would</b> as in
<i>back then we would go there (every Thursday).</i>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English"  target="_top">African-American Vernacular English (<i>AAVE</i>)</a>
 uses <b>be</b> (habitual be) to indicate that  performance of the verb is of a habitual nature:
<p>
<i>Habitual be</i> is the use of an uninflected <i>be</i> in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE),
Caribbean English and Certain dialects of Hiberno-English 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-West_Irish_English" target="_top">South-West Irish English</a>)
to mark habitual or extended actions,  in place of the Standard English inflected forms of be, such as 
is and are.
 <ul>
   <li> I do be thinking about it 
   <li> she does be late
   <li> separately interesting, non-canonical constituent order: <i>Thinking to steal a few eggs I was</i>
 </ul>

<p>
In AAVE, use of <i>be</i> indicates that a subject repeatedly does an action or embodies a trait. In Standard English, the
use of (an inflection of) <i>be</i> merely conveys that an individual has done an action in a
particular tense, such as in the statement "She was singing" (the habitual being "she sings").
<p>
In South-Western Hiberno-English, the habitual takes a different form, with do being added to
the sentence as a supplement. Instead of saying "She is late" or "They are always doing that,"
"She do be late" and "They always be doing that" are used. It is descended from Irish language
grammar and use of the verb Bí, the habitual tense of the verb "to be".
<p>
It is a common misconception that AAVE speakers simply replace <i>is</i> with <i>be</i> across all tenses,
with no added meaning. In fact, AAVE speakers use <i>be</i> to mark a habitual grammatical aspect not
explicitly distinguished in Standard English. For example, <i>to be singing</i> means to sing
habitually, not to presently be singing. In one experiment, children were shown drawings of Elmo
eating cookies while Cookie Monster looked on. Both black and white subjects agreed that Elmo is
eating cookies, but the black children said that Cookie Monster be eating cookies.

"čəd words":
    `
#####čəd words

predicate particles - where, in modern grammar, a particle is a
function word that must be associated with another word or phrase to
impart meaning, i.e., does not have its own lexical
definition. According to this definition, particles are a separate
part of speech and are distinct from other classes of function words,
such as articles, prepositions, conjunctions and adverbs.        


- čəd: I, me
- čəɬ:  we, us
- čəxʷ: you (singular)
- čəɬəp: you folks

additional comments
- čəɬ<sup>2</sup>: [Skagit (only?)] make or hunt for one's use, go after. LD 63
- <i>ləčəɬ čəd</i>: I am on my way to make something.
- <i>čəɬ ƛ’əlayʔ</i>: make canoe, ’make canoes/a canoe/canoes in general’
- contrast <i>čəɬ ti ƛ’əlayʔ</i> ‘make that canoe/the canoe we were talking about/particular canoes’
- David Beck: this is one of a very few verbs that can be used with a noun without a demonstrative or determiner.
`,




"Anaphor":
`
#####Anaphor
The use of an expression whose interpretation depends upon another
expression in context (its antecedent or postcedent).

<p>In a narrower sense, <i>anaphora</i> is the use of an expression that
depends specifically upon an antecedent expression and thus is contrasted
with <i>cataphora</i>, which is the use of an expression that depends upon a
postcedent expression. The anaphoric (referring) term is called an
anaphor. 

<p>For example, in the sentence <i>Sally arrived, but nobody saw her</i>, the
pronoun <i>her</i> is an anaphor, referring back to the antecedent Sally. In the
sentence <i>Before her arrival, nobody saw Sally</i>, the pronoun <i>her</i> refers
forward to the postcedent Sally, so <i>her</i> is now a cataphor (and an anaphor in
the broader, but not the narrower, sense). 

<p>In <i>When they saw Ruth, the men looked slightly abashed</i>,
 the word <i>they</i> is used as a cataphor for <i>the men</i>.

<p>Usually, an anaphoric expression is a proform or some other kind of
deictic (contextually-dependent) expression. Both anaphora and cataphora
are species of endophora, referring to something mentioned elsewhere in a
dialog or text.

<p>A linguistic entity which indicates a referential tie to some other linguistic 
 entity in the same text.

<p>Thus an anaphor is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-form"
 target="_top">proform</a> or some other kind of deictic
 (contextually-dependent) expression, where <i>proform</i> is a word or
 expression which stands in for (expresses the same content as) another
 word, phrase, clause or sentence where the meaning is recoverable from
 context, <i>pronouns</i> being the best known.
`,



"Deixis":
`
#####Deixis
"DIKE-sis". Reference by means of an expression whose interpretation is
 relative to the (usually) extralinguistic context of the utterance, such as:
- who is speaking
- the time or place of speaking
- the gestures of the speaker
- the current location in the discourse

wikipedia: The use of general words and phrases to refer to a specific
time, place, or person in context, e.g., the words tomorrow, there, and
they. Words are deictic if their semantic meaning is fixed but their
denoted meaning varies depending on time and/or place. Words or phrases
that require contextual information to be fully understood—for example,
English pronouns—are deictic. Deixis is closely related to anaphora. In
linguistic anthropology, deixis is treated as a particular subclass of the
more general semiotic phenomenon of indexicality, a sign "pointing to"
some aspect of its context of occurrence.  <p>

- <b>deictic center</b>:  I, here, now
- <b>time deixis</b>: [before, recently, yesterday] now [later, tomorrow, soon]
- <b>space</b>: [there] here [there]
- <b>person</b>: you, me, she/he, they
- <b>deictic projection</b>:  speaker is not in the deictic center: <i> I am coming home now.</i>
- <b>discourse deixis</b>:  <i>That was an amazing account.</i>
- <b>social</b>:  T-V distinction, Latin "tu" and "vos", for languages with at least two
  second person pronouns.

The terms deixis and <b>indexicality</b> are frequently used almost
interchangeably, and both deal with essentially the same idea of
contextually-dependent references. However, the two terms have different
histories and traditions. In the past, deixis was associated specifically
with spatiotemporal reference, and indexicality was used more broadly.[16]
More importantly, each is associated with a different field of
study. Deixis is associated with linguistics, and indexicality is
associated with philosophy[17] as well as pragmatics.[18]

_deixis_ refers to words and phrases, such as "me" or "here", that cannot be fully understood
without additional contextual information—in this case, the identity of the speaker ("me") and
the speaker's location ("here"). Words are deictic if their semantic meaning is fixed but their
denoted meaning varies depending on time and/or place. Words or phrases that require contextual
information to convey any meaning—for example, English pronouns—are deictic.

"Demonstrative":
`
#####Demonstrative

Words which distinguish entities of interest, often used in spatial or discourse deixis,
or as anaphora.  

<h5>English examples</h5> 
<ul>
  <li> As a djective: <i>put <b>that</b> hat on</i>.  
  <li> As pronoun: <i>put <b>that</b> on</i>.
  <li> As adverb: <i>He is not <b>that</b> nice</i>. <i>I came <b>this</b> close</i>. (with accompanying gesture).
</ul>

Lushootseed Reader volume 1, Lesson 15, p77: Demonstratives

The demonstrative systems (pronomial, adjectival, and adverbial) are
complex in Lushootseed for several reasons:

- They involve a fairly large number of concepts.
- There is considerable variation among speakers in their use.  
-  Adjectival and adverbial demonstratives can  enter into a variety of combinations creating 
  still more, and often quite subtle, distinctions than occur in either subclass taken alone.

The basic system, however, is straight forward; and that is what is
presented here.  The complex and sometimes idiosyncratic combinations
are dealt with in footnotes as they occur in the texts.

Five concepts are marked in the basic adjectival system.  These are
distal, proximal, unique reference, non-contrastive (or neutral), and
hypothetical and/or remote.  Each of these can be futhher marked for
feminine.  The specific forms in Northern and Southern Lushootseed
differ in several cases.


|                            | NL.unmarked | NL.marked | SL.unmarked | SL.marked |

"Determiner":
`#####Determiner
A word, phrase, or affix that occurs together with a noun or noun phrase
and serves to express the reference of that noun or noun phrase in the

element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a
particular number or quantity, etc.

"ECS":
`
#####ECS
Event External Causative, the Lushootseed suffix _-txʷ_

Adds participant (a trajector) which is initiator of separate process
of which it is not the trajector (the primary clausal figure).

The notion of ‘separate process’ is a matter of construal and in
practice there is considerable overlap in direct- and indirect-causation (ICS).

Two papers by David Beck:
- <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dbeck/CAUS.pdf" target="_blank">Transitivity and Causation in Lushootseed Morphology</a>.
- <a href="https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/0ebf0b27-5436-404f-b7d8-8c74dd53d35a/view/108859df-0420-4df0-8d16-7208c7d2d2e3/IJAL_75_2009_533_clean.pdf" target="_blank">
         A Taxonomy and Typology of Lushootseed Valency-increasing Suffixes</a>

<b>TRAJECTOR</b> and <b>LANDMARK</b> are the terms proposed by R. Langacker to describe
the semantics of the linguistic expressions denoting simple and complex
events, in which one object (the Trajector) is moving or undergoing
changes in relation to another object (the Landmark).  The line along which
the Trajector is moving, either literally or metaphorically, is called the
<b>Path</b>.

Two important constraints of Lushootseed grammar:
- Only one third-person direct actant (subject or direct object) may be overt in a clause: 
          in transitive clauses, third-person subjects are elided; first- and second-person subjects 
          in transitive clauses are realizable as pronominals, which are not NPs.
-  Oblique (intransitive) objects are not in the verb’s profile and surface as a PP.

"And-fronting":
`
#####And-fronting

- Kroeber p376: and-fronting of determiner phrases (DPs) is rare in Coast Salish languages 
             generally, but fairly common in Lushootseed. 
- Hess v1 p122: The sentential adverb <i>gʷəl</i>, in addtion to starting
    sentences ("and then...") in long narratives, is also used to topicalize.  This is
    achieved by treating the topic as an entire clause and using <i>gʷəl</i> to introduce
    the following clause.

<b>More generally:</b>

- Emphasis: modifying the sense of the sentence.  A <i>sentential adverb</i> is a single word or short phrase, usually interrupting
        normal syntax, used to lend emphasis to words immediately proximal to the adverb:  <i>
        I did, <b>indeed</b>, complete the task. </i>  Or "Reluctantly, he completed the task.".
        
- Topicalization:  the initial position of the adverb is not unlike the <i>wh</i>-position,
        which is unspecified for the kind of <i>wh</i>-element that can occupy it.  The fronted elements
        are <b>topics</b> representing information that is already part of the discourse (aka, old information).
         All of these fronted elements are pronounced with a pause after the initial phrase.
- Unlike wh-elements, topicalization never demonstrates inversion or complementary
        distribution. (More detail <a href="http://primus.arts.u-szeged.hu/bese/Chapter7/7.5.1.htm#1307" target="_blank"> here</a>.)
`,

"Perfective Aspect": 
`
#####Perfective Aspect

  The perfective aspect (abbreviated _pfv_), sometimes called the
  aoristic aspect, is a grammatical aspect that describes an action
  viewed as a simple whole; i.e., a unit without interior
  composition. The perfective aspect is distinguished from the
  imperfective aspect, which presents an event as having internal
  structure (such as ongoing, continuous, or habitual actions).


  The perfective is often thought of as for events of short duration
  (e.g., "John killed the wasp"). However, this is not necessarily
  true—a perfective verb is equally right for a long-lasting event,
  provided that it is a complete whole; e.g., (Livy) "Tarquin the Proud reigned
  for 25 years." It simply "presents an occurrence in summary,
  viewed as a whole from the outside, without regard for the internal
  make-up of the occurrence."



<b>Perfective Aspect vs Perfect Tense</b>

A <i>perfect</i> tense (abbreviated <b>PERF</b> or <b>prf</b>) is a
grammatical form used to describe a past event with present relevance,
or a present state resulting from a past situation. For example, "I
have put it on the table" implies both that I put the object on the
table and that it is still there; "I have been to France" conveys that
this is a part of my experience as of now; and "I have lost my wallet"
implies that this loss is troublesome at the present moment. A perfect
tense does not necessarily have to be perfective in aspect. For
example, "I have been waiting here for an hour" and "I have been going
to that doctor all my life" are perfect but also imperfective in
aspect.

#####Tense and Aspect

Thom Hess, LG1, p49: &nbsp; Obligatory in English, where
every sentence must locate the event before, after,
or during the moment of speaking (or with reference to some other 
event).

Optional in Lushootseed, tense is usually not mentioned.
Lushootseed grammar is instead much concerned with aspect, which
describes the period of time within which an event or process occurs.

Lushootseed verbs are either static or dynamic.  If static, they
typically bear the stative prefix <i><b>ʔəs-</b></i>.  If dynamic,
the divide into two groups called <b>perfective</b> 
(prefix <i><b>ʔu-</b></i>) and <b>imperfective</b> 
(prefix <i><b>lə-</b><i> for progressive, <i><b>ləs-</b></i> for
progressive state).

#####Copula

- word or phrase that links the subject of a sentence to a subject
complement, such as the word "is" in the sentence "The sky is blue" or

word copula derives from the Latin noun for a "link" or "tie" that
connects two different things.

- also called a linking verb, which also includes verbs of perception 
such as look, sound, or taste and some other verbs
that describe the subject, such as seem, become, or remain.

"Salishan Predicates":
`
##### **Salishan Predicates**


<b>Beck 2009: Thematicity in Lushootseed Syntax</b>

One of the more remarkable characteristics of Lushootseed syntax is
the flexibility it displays with respect to which parts of speech
are eligible syntactic predicates (Beck, 2002). As in most Salishan
languages (Kinkade, 1983), words corresponding to English verbs,
nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and demonstrative pronouns are all
potential predicates, as in the nominally-predicated expressions:

(3a) ʔaciɬtalbixʷ čəd<br>
Indian 1SG.SUB<br> 
‘I am an Indian’<br>
(Hess & Hilbert, 1976: vol. I, 36)

(3b) sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ<br>
salmon DIST <br>
‘that is a salmon’<br>
(Hess & Hilbert, 1976: vol. I, 7)

Non-verbal predicates like ʔaciɬtalbixʷ ‘Indian’ take the same subject
inflections as do verbal predicates; copular constructions with NP or
demonstrative subjects like that in (3b) simply juxtapose subject and
predicate, the latter appearing in sentence-initial position. Unlike
nouns and other nominal elements used as arguments, nominal predicates
do not take determiners unless the sentence identifies the subject
with a specific individual.

Non-verbal predicates are not confined to simple expressions of
identity like those in (3) above; constructions like these in (4), with a
nominal predicate and a complex nominal acting as subject, are quite
routine:

(4) wiw’su tiʔəʔ ʔu–čala–d tiʔəʔ sqʷbayʔ<br>
children PROX PFV–chase–ICS PROX dog <br>
‘those who chased the dog are the children’<br>
(Hess, 1995: 99)

The syntactic predicate in (4) is the bare noun wiw’su ‘children’,
while the subject is a relative clause headed by the determiner ti!%!
(Beck, 2002). It is the predicative use of nouns in constructions like
those in (3) and (4) which have led some researchers (e.g., Jelinek &
Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) to argue that there is no
distinction between nouns and verbs in Salishan languages. While this
is probably an over-reaction it is the case that part of speech
plays less of a role in the selection of the syntactic predicate of
a sentence than it does in most other languages, where there is a
strong tendency for sentences to have verbal predicates. Instead,
predicate selection in Lushootseed depends crucially on Communicative
Structure.

The position that Salishan languages do not distinguish nouns and
verbs is not the current consensus position held by most specialists 
in these languages.  See van Eijk & Hess (1986), Kroeber
(1999), and Beck (2002).

<b>Kroeber (1999): Possible fillers of the predicate position and the 
question of word classes (p58)</b>

- The _predicate proper_ may be a word whose English translation is a verb.
However, throughout Salish, it is also perfectly possible for the predicate proper to be
something translatable as an adjective or a noun.  Such predicates take whatever sort of 
person marking is appropriate for intransivitve predicates in the language in question.

- We should say that nouns and adjectives as well as verbs may be the predicates
of clauses in Salish languages.

- Alternatively (as Jelinek and Demers recommend) we should claim that Salish languages
lack a syntactically relevant distinction between "noun", "verb", and "adjective"; 
instead there is a single undifferentiated class (to be labeled, perhaps, "potential
predicate") into which the Salish translation equivalent of English nouns, verbs, and
adjectives fall.

- I return later (section 1.5.5, p76) to the issue of what major lexical classes ought
to be recognized in Salish.  For now, it will help to keep matters straight if we 
carefully distinguish between syntactic positions, such as "predicate" -- the 
syntactic positionh that is followed by subject and object nominal expression
in unmarked order, that may be proceeded by auxilliaries or certain adverbs [p59].

"Theme and Rheme":
`
#####Theme and Rheme
- Theme: what the sentence is concerned with.
- Rheme: that which is communicated about the Theme, or the event contained 
in the Theme.

The most obvious context to see this is in a question/answer pair:
- _Who will Bill meet?_ [Th: Bill meet] [Rh Fred]
- _Who met Fred_?  [Rh: Bill] [Th: met Fred]

In Salishan and neighbouring languages, there is a requirement that
the syntactic predicate be the Rheme. Lushootseed:

[Rh ƛ’al’ bəʔusaxʷəbdubut ] [Th tiʔiɬ kikəwič ]<br>
ƛ’al’	bə=ʔu–saxʷəb–dxʷ–but	tiʔiɬ	kikəwič<br>
also	ADD=PFV–escape–DC–REFL	DIST	Little.Hunchback<br>
‘Little Hunchback also managed to escape’ <br>
(<< “what happened to Little Hunchback?”)<br>

[Rh kikəwič ] [Th tiʔiɬ bəsusaxʷəbdubuts ]<br>
kikəwič	tiʔiɬ	bə=s=ʔu–saxʷəb–dxʷ–but=s ]<br>
Little.Hunchback	DIST	ADD=NML=PFV–escape–DC–REFL=3PO<br>
‘the one who managed to escape was Little Hunchback’<br>
 (<< “who managed to escape?”)<br>
-	the predicate of a Salishan sentence is the Rheme, no matter what its part of speech
-	Thematic verbs become Subjects inside a “headless” relative clause

In Lushootseed, with restrictions (or strong preferences) that
Subjects be Themes, promotional voices like the passive can be used to
ensure that the Thematic element is the Subject

ʔuhaydxʷ čəx̌ ʔu ti sʔuhuyutəbs tiʔiɬ sčətxʷəd<br>

Also known as _conjuctive adverb_ or _subordinating adverb_ - these

##### Types of Sentences
These classifications are based on the number of independent and
dependent clauses a sentence contains. An independent clause forms a
complete sentence on its own, while a dependent clause needs another
clause to make a complete sentence.

- **simple**: a single independent clause, a subject and predicate that form a complete thought.
     - _The girl bought an ice cream cone._
     - _The girl bought an ice cream cone and took it to the park._
     - _The girl - a freckle-faced brunette, about ten years old, in a striped 
       dress and sandals - bought an ice cream cone and took it to the park._
- **compound**: IC+CC+IC.  Two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction,
   (and, but, yet, for, or, nor, so), a conjunctive adverb (however, furthermore,
    likewise, rather, therfore) or a semicolon.
     - _The girl bought an ice cream cone, but she dropped it in the park._
- **compound**: IC+S+IC
     - _I went for a walk; I was soothed by the gentle night air._
- **compound**: IC+AC+IC.  Linked by adverbial conjunction.
     - _I went for a walk; consequently,  I was soothed by the gentle night air._
- **complex**: DC+C+IC.  One or more dependent clauses attached to an independent clause.
    The dependent clauses are connected to the independent clause through
    subordinating conjuctions (_because, after, when_) or relative pronouns
    (_who, which, that_).
     - _After she bought an ice cream cone, the girl went to the park._
     - _The girl dropped her ice cream cone because a large dog knocked her over._
     - _The girl, who had a freckled face and wore a striped shirt, was knocked over by a large dog, which ate her ice cream cone._
- **complex**: DM+C+IC.  Dependent marker plus clause pluse independent clause:
     - _Because I hoped to be soothed by the gentle night air, I went for a walk._
- **complex**: RP+C.  Relative pronoun + clause.
     - _Whatever doubts I had about taking a walk dissipated when I was soothed by the gentle night air._
- **compound-complex**: DC+IC+CC+IC. one or more dependent clauses attached to one or more independent  clauses.
     - _After she bought an ice cream cone, the girl, who had a freckled face and wore a striped shirt, went to the park, but she was knocked over by a large dog, which ate her treat, so she ran home to her mother, who made her an ice cream sundae._
