<h3> How Daylight Was Stolen</h3>

Recorded by Leon Metcalf, 1 November 1952 (Metcalf tape 23), with
Harry Moses, a speaker of the Upper Skagit dialect.  Mr. Moses was of
Sauk-Suiattle and Entiat heritage [Hilbert 2020].  The story was first
transcribed by Vi Taqʷšəblu Hilbert (9 May 1976), with further
redaction by Vi Hilbert and Tom Hess.  Published, with interlinear
analysis, in substantially different form as Hilbert and Hess 1977.  A
preliminary version of the analysis presented here [Beck and Hess,
2015] was published in Beck and Hess 2010.

Vi Hilbert loaned me a cassette audio tape copy of this recording, in
2005, after she learned of my interest in this story.  I have studied
it intermittently in the subsequent years, keeping track of my
understanding - and my confusions - in this web app.  I pay particular
attention to the sounds and the flow, so my division of lines, and
some of my transcriptions differ from those of Hilbert, Hess and Beck.
Despite this offbest strategy, David Beck has been unfailingly
helpful.

<p> I have privately published this ongoing work, without promotion, on the web,
blocked from web search engines.   I will create password protection
if ever asked to do so.  I hope that its current obscurity - it has
not been indexed by google - is appropriate for my personal study and
occastional collaborator access - and does not infringe upon the
heritage of which it is a part.  I welcome judgements to the
contrary.  Contact

<p>I offer all honor and respect to Mr. Moses, his language and Salish
culture - past, present and for all time to come.

We have generalized the software used here so that it works with any
interlinearized, media-accompanied text.  Tlingit and Halkomelem
projects are in process.  A demonstration, using the first three lines
of Dante's Inferno, is available
