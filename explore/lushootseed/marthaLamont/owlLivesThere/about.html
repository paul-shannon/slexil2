   This audio-linked transcription is offered here for limited
   distribution only.  Obscured from from web search
   engines, it is intended only for the Lushootseed community, until
   and unless that community proposes wider distribution.

	<p> We cannot improve upon the epigraph of Beck and Hess 2014,
	  Volume 1 (here slighly rephrased):
      <div style="margin: 80px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
		 <i>This is for the Elders - Elder speakers and Elder
		 linguists - in the hope that it will live on in the hearts of
		 the younger.</i>

	  <h4> Martha Lamont</h4>
	  (The following account of Mrs. Lamont is drawn from Beck
	  and Hess 2014, and based upon "the memories of Hank and Geraldine
	  Williams, the late Vi Taqʷšəblu Hilbert, the late Thom Hess, the
	  late Marya Moses, and Wayne Williams.")
	<p><p>

    Perhaps because she never learned to read or write, Martha was an
    enthusiastic participant in projects to tape-record traditional
    teachings. She spent extended periods ten years apart working
    with different collectors, to whom she told some of the same
    stories.  Thus, her legacy gives us a rare chance to investigate
    change and stability in <i>syəhub</i> tradition.


    <h5>
     Adapted From Lushootseed Reader Volume II by Thom Hess:</h5>
     <p> When students listen to the recording, they will
     notice that Mrs. Lamont speaks with a
     rhythm and intonation that is alien to English.
	  <p>
		 Students will also note that Mrs. Lamont spoke very rapidly
		 when telling the old stories.  (Her everyday speech by contrast
		 was usually rather slow and measured.)  This rapid rate of
		 storytelling was just one of many special oral effects once
		 commonly employed in her region of Lushootseed speaking
		 territory.  It was not used everywhere but it was not unique to
		 Mrs. Lamont either.
	  <p>
		 A third trait of Mrs. Lamont's storytelling is the frequent use
		 of very long sentences.  More accurately stated, Mrs. Lamont
		 often articulates a sequence of several grammatical sentences
		 as one long phonological sentence, i.e., she says several
		 sentences all in one breath. [<i>In preparing this web version
		 from Beck &amp; Hess 2014, I mostly respect the grammatical
		 sentences, but sometimes present phonological sentences
		 instead, to better fit the medium. - Paul Shannon</i>]
	  <p>
		 Traditional Lushootseed oral style leaves more to context than
		 does typical English storytelling.  It also assumes an audience
		 who has heard these stories many, many times before.   What
		 matters is style and art, not plot.  Omissions and "short cuts"
		 do not trouble the Native listener who easily provides from
		 memory what is left unexpressed.
