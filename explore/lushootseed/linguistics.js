"Tense":

#####Tense

Thom Hess, LG1, p49: &nbsp; Obligatory in English, where
every sentence must locate the event before, after,
or during the moment of speaking (or with reference to some other 
event).

Optional in Lushootseed, tense is usually not mentioned.
Lushootseed grammar is instead much concerned with aspect, which
describes the period of time within which an event or process occurs.

Lushootseed verbs are either static or dynamic.  If static, they
typically bear the stative prefix <i><b>ʔəs-</b></i>.  If dynamic,
the divide into two groups called <b>perfective</b> 
(prefix <i><b>ʔu-</b></i>) and <b>imperfective</b> 
(prefix <i><b>lə-</b><i> for progressive, <i><b>ləs-</b></i> for
progressive state).

"Copula":
`
#####Copula

- word or phrase that links the subject of a sentence to a subject
complement, such as the word "is" in the sentence "The sky is blue" or
the phrase "was not being" in the sentence "It was not being used." The
word copula derives from the Latin noun for a "link" or "tie" that
connects two different things.

- also called a linking verb, which also includes verbs of perception 
such as look, sound, or taste and some other verbs
that describe the subject, such as seem, become, or remain.

##### **Salishan Predicates**


<b>Beck 2009: Thematicity in Lushootseed Syntax</b>

One of the more remarkable characteristics of Lushootseed syntax is
the flexibility it displays with re- spect to which parts of speech
are eligible syntactic predicates (Beck, 2002). As in most Salishan
languages (Kinkade, 1983), words corresponding to English verbs,
nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and demon- strative pronouns are all
potential predicates, as in the nominally-predicated expressions:

(3a) ʔaciɬtalbixʷ čəd<br>
Indian 1SG.SUB<br> 
‘I am an Indian’<br>
(Hess & Hilbert, 1976: vol. I, 36)

(3b) sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ<br>
salmon DIST <br>
‘that is a salmon’<br>
(Hess & Hilbert, 1976: vol. I, 7)

Non-verbal predicates like ʔaciɬtalbixʷ ‘Indian’ take the same subject
inflections as do verbal predicates; copular constructions with NP or
demonstrative subjects like that in (3b) simply juxtapose subject and
predicate, the latter appearing in sentence-initial position. Unlike
nouns and other nominal elements used as arguments, nominal predicates
do not take determiners unless the sentence identifies the subject
with a specific individual.

Non-verbal predicates are not confined to simple expressions of
identity like those in (3) above; constructions like these in (4), with a
nominal predicate and a complex nominal acting as subject, are quite
routine:

(4) wiw’su tiʔəʔ ʔu–čala–d tiʔəʔ sqʷbayʔ<br>
children PROX PFV–chase–ICS PROX dog <br>
‘those who chased the dog are the children’<br>
(Hess, 1995: 99)

The syntactic predicate in (4) is the bare noun wiw’su ‘children’,
while the subject is a relative clause headed by the determiner ti!%!
(Beck, 2002). It is the predicative use of nouns in constructions like
those in (3) and (4) which have led some researchers (e.g., Jelinek &
Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) to argue that there is no
distinction between nouns and verbs in Salishan languages. While this
is probably an over-reaction it is the case that part of speech
plays less of a role in the selection of the syntactic predicate of
a sentence than it does in most other languages, where there is a
strong tendency for sentences to have verbal predicates. Instead,
predicate selection in Lushootseed depends crucially on Communicative
Structure.

The position that Salishan languages do not distinguish nouns and
verbs is not the current consensus position held by most specialists 
in these languages.  See van Eijk & Hess (1986), Kroeber
(1999), and Beck (2002).

<b>Kroeber (1999): Possible fillers of the predicate position and the 
question of word classes (p58)</b>

- The _predicate proper_ may be a word whose English translation is a verb.
However, throughout Salish, it is also perfectly possible for the predicate proper to be
something translatable as an adjective or a noun.  Such predicates take whatever sort of 
person marking is appropriate for intransivitve predicates in the language in question.

- We should say that nouns and adjectives as well as verbs may be the predicates
of clauses in Salish languages.

- Alternatively (as Jelinek and Demers recommend) we should claim that Salish languages
lack a syntactically relevant distinction between "noun", "verb", and "adjective"; 
instead there is a single undifferentiated class (to be labeled, perhaps, "potential
predicate") into which the Salish translation equivalent of English nouns, verbs, and
adjectives fall.

- I return later (section 1.5.5, p76) to the issue of what major lexical classes ought
to be recognized in Salish.  For now, it will help to keep matters straight if we 
carefully distinguish between syntactic positions, such as "predicate" -- the 
syntactic positionh that is followed by subject and object nominal expression
in unmarked order, that may be proceeded by auxilliaries or certain adverbs [p59].

"Theme and Rheme":
`
#####Theme and Rheme
- Theme: what the sentence is concerned with.
- Rheme: that which is communicated about the Theme, or the event contained 
in the Theme.

The most obvious context to see this is in a question/answer pair:
- _Who will Bill meet?_ [Th: Bill meet] [Rh Fred]
- _Who met Fred_?  [Rh: Bill] [Th: met Fred]

In Salishan and neighbouring languages, there is a requirement that
the syntactic predicate be the Rheme. Lushootseed:

[Rh ƛ’al’ bəʔusaxʷəbdubut ] [Th tiʔiɬ kikəwič ]<br>
ƛ’al’	bə=ʔu–saxʷəb–dxʷ–but	tiʔiɬ	kikəwič<br>
also	ADD=PFV–escape–DC–REFL	DIST	Little.Hunchback<br>
‘Little Hunchback also managed to escape’ <br>
(<< “what happened to Little Hunchback?”)<br>

[Rh kikəwič ] [Th tiʔiɬ bəsusaxʷəbdubuts ]<br>
kikəwič	tiʔiɬ	bə=s=ʔu–saxʷəb–dxʷ–but=s ]<br>
Little.Hunchback	DIST	ADD=NML=PFV–escape–DC–REFL=3PO<br>
‘the one who managed to escape was Little Hunchback’<br>
 (<< “who managed to escape?”)<br>
-	the predicate of a Salishan sentence is the Rheme, no matter what its part of speech
-	Thematic verbs become Subjects inside a “headless” relative clause

In Lushootseed, with restrictions (or strong preferences) that
Subjects be Themes, promotional voices like the passive can be used to
ensure that the Thematic element is the Subject

ʔuhaydxʷ čəx̌ ʔu ti sʔuhuyutəbs tiʔiɬ sčətxʷəd<br>
ʔuhaydxʷ	čəx̌	ʔu	ti	s=ʔu–huyu–t–əb=s	tiʔiɬ	sčətxʷəd<br>
know	2SG:SUB	INT	DEF	NML=PFV–do.to–ICS–PASS=3PO	DIST	bear<br>
‘do you know what happened to Bear?’</br>

[Rh	c’əldub ʔə tiʔiɬ c’ix̌c’ix̌ ] [Th tiʔiɬ sčətxʷəd ]<br>
c’əldxʷ–b	ʔə	tiʔiɬ	c’ix̌c’ix̌	tiʔiɬ	sčətxʷəd<br>
defeat–PASS	PREP	DIST	fish.hawk	DIST	bear<br>
‘Bear was defeated by Fish Hawk’<br>

-	‘Bear’ is the Thematic element in the second sentence
-	‘Bear’ is PATIENT of the event, which is the Direct Object of the active form of the verb c’əldxʷ ‘defeat someone’
-	the passive voice is used to ensure that ‘Bear’ is the Subject

"Adverbial Conjunction":
`
#####Adverbial Conjunction
Also known as _conjuctive adverb_ or _subordinating adverb_ - these
connect two clauses, providing a transition between them.  They are
adverbs in that they expand upon the verb phrase in the previous clause.
Separated by period or semi-colon, the two clauses cannot be joined into a
single sentence.

_Mary understood the proper use of adverbial conjunctions; therefore, she scored well on
her grammer quiz._

- accordingly
- also
- anyway
- besides
- certainly
- consequently
- finally
- furthermore
- hence
- however
- in addition
- in fact
- incidentally
- indeed
- instead
- lately
- likewise
- meanwhile
- moreover
- nevertheless
- next
- nonetheless
- now
- otherwise
- rather
- similarly
- since
- still
- subsequently
- then
- thereby
- therefore
- thus

"Coordinating Conjunction":
`
#####Coordinating Conjunction
Conjoin pieces of sentence (words, phrases, clauses) that share a syntactic function.
English has seven, acronym FANBOYS.

_Get me a dog and a beer._

- for:  indicates causation 
- and:  lists without specifying relationships
- nor:  supplements a previously stated negation
- but:  signals contradiction, caveat, or other tension
- or:   indicates alternatives
- yet:  nevertheless or in spite of
- so:   indicates reasoning or causal effect

"Types of Sentences (MLA)":
`
##### Types of Sentences
These classifications are based on the number of independent and
dependent clauses a sentence contains. An independent clause forms a
complete sentence on its own, while a dependent clause needs another
clause to make a complete sentence.

- **simple**: a single independent clause, a subject and predicate that form a complete thought.
     - _The girl bought an ice cream cone._
     - _The girl bought an ice cream cone and took it to the park._
     - _The girl - a freckle-faced brunette, about ten years old, in a striped 
       dress and sandals - bought an ice cream cone and took it to the park._
- **compound**: IC+CC+IC.  Two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction,
   (and, but, yet, for, or, nor, so), a conjunctive adverb (however, furthermore,
    likewise, rather, therfore) or a semicolon.
     - _The girl bought an ice cream cone, but she dropped it in the park._
- **compound**: IC+S+IC
     - _I went for a walk; I was soothed by the gentle night air._
- **compound**: IC+AC+IC.  Linked by adverbial conjunction.
     - _I went for a walk; consequently,  I was soothed by the gentle night air._
- **complex**: DC+C+IC.  One or more dependent clauses attached to an independent clause.
    The dependent clauses are connected to the independent clause through
    subordinating conjuctions (_because, after, when_) or relative pronouns
    (_who, which, that_).
     - _After she bought an ice cream cone, the girl went to the park._
     - _The girl dropped her ice cream cone because a large dog knocked her over._
     - _The girl, who had a freckled face and wore a striped shirt, was knocked over by a large dog, which ate her ice cream cone._
- **complex**: DM+C+IC.  Dependent marker plus clause pluse independent clause:
     - _Because I hoped to be soothed by the gentle night air, I went for a walk._
- **complex**: RP+C.  Relative pronoun + clause.
     - _Whatever doubts I had about taking a walk dissipated when I was soothed by the gentle night air._
- **compound-complex**: DC+IC+CC+IC. one or more dependent clauses attached to one or more independent  clauses.
     - _After she bought an ice cream cone, the girl, who had a freckled face and wore a striped shirt, went to the park, but she was knocked over by a large dog, which ate her treat, so she ran home to her mother, who made her an ice cream sundae._
     - _As I headed out for a walk, my doubts about doing so dissipated, and I was soothed by the gentle night air._
