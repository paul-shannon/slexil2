`
__stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ__

In slow, deliberate speech, _əw'ə_ is prononoucned _haw'əʔ_ (howʔ-wuʔ).  It is spelled
here to represent the way it is often said in relaxed talking.

Imitate whatever pronunciation the teacher uses regardless of how it is written here.

The ' over the w indicates a slight tightening of the throat while the
word is being said.  However, this is one of the few places where such
tightening may be omitted without causing misunderstanding.

`
__spaʔc tiʔiɬ__

"(A) bear that (is)."

"sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ":
`
__sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ__

__sʔuladxʷ__ is used by the Skagit and Snohomis.  The other groups say __sčədadxʷ__
(scyu-day-dwh) for salmon (and seagoing trout - both anadromous fish):

__Note__: five species of Northwest anadramous fish (salmon, steelhead, and certain
bull trout)  migrate from
freshwater rivers to the ocean and back to spawn in their natal
streams. These populations of fish play an integral role in the
wildlife community as bears, otters, eagles, and many others feast on
salmon carcasses as a main source of protein when other food is
scarce.

Pacific salmonid populations truly are a "gift from the sea" as they
bring nutrients from the marine environment back to the river and
terrestrial ecosytem. As well as a significant food source for other
fish and wildlife, the life cycle of various anadromous salmon stocks
facilitates the transport of key marine-derived nutrients like carbon,
nitrogen and phosphorus to PNW forests, lakes, rivers and streams.
