"sq̓əčqs ʔu tiʔiɬ ʔal tə stuləkʷ.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 8.10, page 39**

__sq̓əčqs__, the Skagit word for silver salmon, consists of

  - __q̓əč__:  curve, bend
  - __-qs__:  nose, point

and the nominalizer __s__ mentioned at the end of the new vocabulary of section two.
Thus, the name literally means _bent nose_.

"pastəd čəxʷ (ʔ)u.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 8.9, page 39**:

The word for whiteman derives from the English name "Boston"
reflecting the fact that the first group of white people
to settle permanently in the area came from Boston.  Originally,
__pastəd__ referred only  to English speaking Americans and not to
the men of the Hudson Bay Company, not to the French nor to any
other group of whites.

For whiteman in general __xʷəltəb__ was used.
Today some Lushootseed speaking Indians still maintain the distinction.
Others used __pastəd__ and __xʷəltəb__ interchangeably.

"ʔaciɬtalbixʷ (ʔ)u tiʔiɬ stubš ʔal tudiʔ diʔi.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 8.8, page 39**:

Both words in the phrase __tudiʔ diʔi__ "way over there" are built
upon the same element __diʔ__.

`,

"xʷiʔ čəd ləpastəd.":
`
**Grammar Note 8.4**

Lushootseed has too ways of saying "is not".  In this lesson, one
of them is presented.

The word __xʷi__ "no" is said first followed by __lə-__ fixed to the beginning
of the negated word.  (See, for example, the answering sentence in B8.3.)
The same order is used to express "am not" except that __čəd__ is put in between
__xʷi__ and __lə-__.  (See the answering sentence in B8.1.)

Since __čəxʷ__, __čəɬ_, and __čələp__ are all the same type of word as
__čəd__, they too come bgetween __xʷi__ and __lə-__, e.g.,

  - __xʷi čəxʷ lədxʷ<u>l</u>əbiʔ__ "You are not Lummi"
  - __xʷi čəɬ lədxʷ<u>l</u>əbiʔ__ "We are not Lummi"
  - __xʷi čəɬəp lədxʷ<u>l</u>əbiʔ__ "You folks are not Lummi"
`,

"ʔaciɬtalbixʷ čələp (ʔ)u.":
`
**Grammar Note 8.3**

Lushootseed has two words for "you" whereas English has but one.
The two are __čəxʷ__ and __čələp__.  The first is used when talking to only
one person, the second when talking to two or more people.

`,

"ʔaciɬtalbixʷ čəxʷ (ʔ)u.":
`
**Section 8 Note, Vocabulary Comment 8.7**

__təgqčiʔ__, the word for eight, means literally "close hand(s)"
and may derived from an ancient way of counting on the fingers
whereby all the fingers are brought down against the palm, one
by one, leaving closed hands except for the thumbs, which presumably
were counted last for nine and ten.

This hypothesis, however, does not jibe with the Southern Lushootseed
word for six, __dᶻəlačiʔ__.  Possibly there used be two different methods
of counting on the fngers, both of which left their influence on the
number words.

**Grammar Note 8.2**:

When specific question words such as __stab__, __čad__, __gʷat__ are not
used, questions are formed with the word __ʔu__.  This little word
turns a statement into a question:

   -  __sqigʷəc tiʔiɬ__:  "That is a deer."
   - __sqigʷəc ʔu tiʔiɬ__:  "Is that a deer?"
   
Note that __ʔu__ comes after worlds like __čəxʷ__ and __čələp__ but before
__ti__, __tiʔiɬ__, etc.:

   - ... __čəxʷ (ʔ)u__ "Are you ...?"
   - __ʔu tiʔiɬ ...__ "Is that ...?"

(Very often __ʔ__ is ommited from __ʔu__ in relaxed speech
so that this little question word sounds like a part of the preceeding
word.  Some people pronounce it __(ʔ)o̅__ while others say __(ʔ)oo__
(as in the English word "boot").)

"dᶻətgʷadac ʔu tiʔiɬ ʔal tudiʔ.":
`
**Footnote 3, page 37***

___dᶻətgʷadac___ is the Skagit word for salmonberry bush.  The
Snohomish equivalent is ___stəgʷadac___.  Some Southern Lushootseed
groups say ___dᶻətgʷadac___, e.g., some Snoqualmie people.  Other groups use
___stəgʷadac___.

**Vocabulary Comment 8.11, page 40**

The ending __-ac__ (often pronounced as though spelled __-əc__) means tree
or bush.  Thus __dᶻətgʷad__ is "salmonberry"  but __dᶻətgʷadac__ is
"salmonberry bush", and __x̌payʔ__ means "red cedar" while __x̌payʔac__ means
"red cedar tree".

`,

"xʷiʔ ləsq̓əčqs. yubəč tiʔiɬ.":
`
**Footnote 2, page 37***

___yubəč___ is Northern Lushootseed.  The Southern Lushootseed word for
king salmon is ___sac̓əb.
`,

"sq̓əčqs ʔu tiʔiɬ ʔal tə stuləkʷ.":
`
**Sound and Symbol, page 37, note 8.1:**

___q̓___ is like ___q___ plus a cath in the throat at the same time.

**Footnote 1, page 37**

___sq̓əčqs___ is the Skagit word for silver salmon.  (It means literally
"bent nose".)  The Snohomish equivalent terms is ___skʷxʷic___ while the
Southern Lushootseed say ___skʷəxʷic___.  (The difference between the
Snohomish and Souther Lushootseed terms is only a matter of where the
stress (accent) falls.  The Snohomis stress the end of the word while the
Southern Lushootseed speakers stress the beginning.  Compare 3.16)
`,


"tul̓ʔal s<u>qʷ</u>aliʔ.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 7.6.4**

***s<u>qʷ</u>aliʔ*** "grass", "hay" refers to the large prairie in much of
the Nisqually territory. (The Skagit equivalent for ***sqʷaliʔ*** is ***sax̌ʷil***.
The Snohomish and all Southern Lushootseed groups use ***sqʷaliʔ***.)
`,



"tul̓ʔal <u>p</u>uyaləp.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 7.6.3**

***<u>p</u>uyaləp*** like <b>dxʷ<u>l</u>iləp</b> is  also made up of three parts:

   - ***puy*** "curve", "bend"
   - ***al*** refers to location in a general way
   - ***-əp*** from an old suffix (in an earlier period of the language) meaning "river".
     (Compare ***apš*** "river" in the related language Upper Chehalis.)

Thus the name means "river of bends" i.e., "winding river"
`,


"tul̓ʔal dxʷ<u>l</u>iləp.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 7.6.2**

***dxʷ<u>l</u>iləp*** is composed of three parts:

   -  ***lil*** "far", "distant"
   -  ***-əp*** (from **-ap**) "bottom", "end"
   -  ***dxʷ-*** "to", "toward"


Thus, the names means "far to the end (of the bay)" which describes the length of Tulalip Bay.
`,


"tul̓ʔal <u>d</u>əwʔabš.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 7.6.1**

***<u>d</u>əwʔabš*** means "the people of the inside".

***<u>d</u>əwʔ***,  a variant of the word ***dəkʷ/dəgʷa-***
"inside", is the name for the Cedar, Black and Duwamish River Drainage.  It
designates the region inside as opposed to the open area along the shores
of the Sound.  (see map for the river courses before they were changed in
the present century.)  The ending ***-abš*** means "people of".

**Vocabulary Comment 7.7**

The student will observe that many Indian names are rendered in English with <u>m</u>
and <u>n</u> whereas the people themsleves use a <u>b</u> and <u>d</u>, as with

For example:

   - ***-(a)bš***: <u>d</u>əwʔabš.
   - ***-(a)mish***: Duwamish.

The reason is that when the ***pastəd*** "whiteman" first arrived in the
area, the languages used <u>m</u>'s and <u>n</u>'s so Indian names were
borrowed into English with those sounds.

Within the last one hundred years of so the language has changed from
<u>m</u> and <u>n</u> to the use of <u>b</u> and <u>d</u>.

Even today, however, <u>m</u> and <u>n</u> are heard in special
vocabularies as some proper names and religious ters, and in certain
styles of speaking and singing.  This is especially true in prayer,
talking endearingly to children, and quoting the speech of certain
animals and other supernatural beings.

`,


"tul̓ʔal čəd s<u>w</u>ədəbš.":
`
**Vocabulary Comment 7.6**

Many Lushootseed proper names are so old that their original
meaning is lost in history.  However, some names are composed of
words that are still part of the modern language.

The meaning of ***s<u>w</u>əbəš*** is not readily apparent.
The ending ***-əbš*** (from ***-abš**, "people of") is the only part of the
word that is easily interpreted today.

`,


"tul̓čad čəxʷ.":
`
**Grammar Note 7.3, Sound Note 7.2 page 32**

The student has already learned the words ***čad*** "where"
(Lesson Four) and ***ʔal*** "location" (2.3).

***tul̓-*** "from"
combines with these words making ***tul̓čad*** "from where" and ***tul̓ʔal***
"be from".


The sentence ***tul̓čad čəxʷ*** is a general question and can be used
in many situations.  However, when asking specifically about a person's
home village or lineage, it is possible to say ***sčads čəxʷ***.

In answering either question, the same replay may be said, ***tul̓ʔal čəd ____***.
For the beginning student only the first phrasing should be used.

***l̓*** is usually pronounced as a sequence of ***l*** plus ***ʔ***
or ***ʔ*** plus ***l***.  When ***l*** is followed by ***a**, ***ə***,
***i*** or ***u***, it sounds like ***ʔl***.

When followed by any other letter or when at the end of a word, it sounds
like ***lʔ***.

Thus _tul̓čad_ is pronounced as though it were spelled ***tulʔad***.

In the case of ***tul̓ʔal***, however, the expected pronunciation
***tulʔal** is not used.  Instead, the Luhsootseed say it ias
if it were spelled ***tuʔal***.
`,


"<u>m</u>ali tsi sdaʔs.":
`
**Note 6.4, page 28**

If the name referred to belongs to a woman, many Lushootseed
speakers say ___tsi sdaʔs___ instead of ___ti sdaʔs___; but some people
use ___ti sdaʔs___ with either men's or women's names.   Of those women
who say ___tsi sdaʔs___ with other women's names, most nevertheles say
___tə dsdaʔ___ with their own names and not ___tsə dsdaʔ___.  A few, however,
do say ___tsə dsdaʔ___.  The student should follow the teacher's preference;
and if in doubt, omit the ___s___. 
`,



"<u>h</u>ədli ti sdaʔs.":
`
**Note 6.4, page 28**

Capitalization is achieved in Lushootseed by underlining
the letter rather than by making it bigger.  Only names of
people and places are capitalized - not the first word in a sentence
as in English writing.

**Note 6.5, page 28**

The ___-s___ ending can mean _his, her_ or _its_.   The situation
makes clear wheter a man, woman or object/animal is referred to just
as in English "their" can refer to either sex and to animals and objects
as well as humans.
<p>

By adding the word ___(h)əlgʷəʔ___ after the ___-s___, the speaker
makes definite that he is talking about someone or something
possessed by more than one person (or animal/object).   Thus,
___ti sqʷəbay (h)əlgʷəʔ___ means "their dog".  However, if it is already
known that more than one owner is involved ___(h)əlgʷəʔ___ is usually
omitted.

`,


"gʷat kʷ(i) adsaʔ.":
`
**Note 6.2, page 28**

The word ___gʷat___ is most often equivalent to _who_ (as in Lesson Three).
However, when asking for someone's name, ___gʷat___ is translated by "what".
Thus, Lushootseed speakers say, "Who is your name?" or "Who are you called?"
when in English people say "What is your name?".

**Note 6.3, page 28**

In addition to the meanings give in __5.2__, ___kʷi___ is also used when
asking about something totally new or unknow to the questioner.

"čad kʷi sʔuladxʷ.":
`
**Note 5.2, page 23**

___kʷi___ belongs to the same class of words presented in 5.6 that
point out or paticularlize items under discussions.  ___kʷi___ is said
when referring to something vague and/or remote in time or place,
or when there is some doubt as to its existence.  Comprare __5.7__ and __5.9__.
<p>
___kʷi___ belongs to Set I (4.6).  The Set II ("feminine")
counterpart is ___kʷsi___ (throughout the entire Lushootseed language area).

"čad kʷi sqʷəbayʔ.":
`
**Footnote 1, page 23**

_sqʷubay_ in some parts of the Southern Lushootseed area, e.g., Muckleshoot

**Note 5.1, page 23**

___qʷ___ is similar to ___kʷ___ except that ___qʷ___ is made with the
tongue further back in the mouth.

<p>As with ___q___, it may help to try
pushing the finger against the tip of the tounge while saying _quart_.

<p> Just as ___kʷ___ is like ___k___ except that the lips are rounded for
the former sound, so ___qʷ___ is like ___q___ but with the added lip rounding.
.

"ʔəsʔitut diʔabac ʔal tə səxʷgʷədil.":
`
**Footnote 2, page 22**

All groups use _səxʷgʷədil_ "chair" except some Skagit who instead say
_xʷt'agʷtap_.

"ʔuʔukʷʔukʷ tsi dbəda ʔal ti ʔalʔal.":
`
**Footnote 2, page 16**

The Southern Lushootseed equivalent to _ʔuʔukʷʔukʷ_ (English "play") is
_ʔuč'aʔa_. <p>
The _ʔu-_ at the beginning of these action words is explained
in Lesson Nineteen.
`,


"ʔuyayus ʔal tudiʔ.":
`
**Grammar Note 4.5**

As in many American Indian languages, there is no word in Lushootseed
quite like _he_ or _she_.  (See footnote 1 just below).  However, if
the speaker does not choose to name specifically the person spoken
about, there really is no need to use any word such as _he_ or _she_.
<p>
There never is any confusion because words for _I_, _we_, and _you_ do exist.  So if the
person referred to is not _me_, _us_, or _you_, it has to be _he_ or _she_.
<p>
(The situation makes clear wheter a man or woman is referred to.  The way of saying
_they_ is presented in a later lesson.)

**Footnote 1 page 18**

The apparent exception to this statement is _diɬ_: _he_, _she_, or _it is (the one)_,
line 3.5.  However, _diɬ_ is used only when singling out the person (or thing) for special
emphasis and is never used in neutral statements such as those in Choral Repetition of
Lesson Four.  More information on the use of _diɬ_ is presented in a later lesson.

`,

"ʔuyayus ti dbad ʔal tudiʔ.":
`
**Grammar Note 4.4**

In Lushootseed, the action word usually comes before the actor - just the
opposite of English word order.
`,

"čad t(i) abad.":
`
**Footnote 1**

In the sentences of this lesson, Southern Lushootseed speakers say _šə_
and _sə_ in place of _ti_ and _tsi_, e.g., _čad š(i) abad__,
"where is your father?".
<p>
See **4.2** and **4.3** for an explanation of the parentheses.  See **3.6** and **4.6** for
the distinction between _ti_ and _tsi_, _šə_ and _sə_.

**Grammar Note 4.1**

_ad-_ at the beginning of a word means _your_.

**Grammar Note 4.2**

When talking at a relaxed and not over careful rate, _ti_ and _ad-_ usually flow together and sould like
one word, _tad_.  The reason they are separated by a space is because another word can be added between.
For example, it is possible to say _čad ti siʔab adbad_, "Where is your esteemed father?".

**Grammar Note 4.3**

A letter written within parentheses, ___()___, is NOT pronounced.
Thus, _i_ is lost before _a_ in the first question of #1.  However,
this _i-sound_ returns when _a_ does not follow it.  See the second sentence,
the answer, in #1.

(Compare English spelling which often keeps letters for sounds that sometimes drop, e.g., the _n_ in _hymn_
and _hymnal_.)


`,



"k'ʷ: k'ʷədad":
`
**Grammar Note 3.2, page 11**

_k'ʷ_ is something like saying _qu_ (of _queen_) with a catch in the
throat simultaneously.  As with _č'_, _k'ʷ_ is a combination of _kʷ_
and _ʔ_.  There is no sound like it in English.

`,



"gʷat əw'ə tiʔiɬ sɬadəy ʔal tudiʔ.":
`
**Grammar Note 3.3, page 11**

_əy_ sounds like _i_ in the English word _bite_ as pronounced by
Canadians.  The difference in sound between _ay_ and _əy_ is very
slight and of no importance in Lushootseed.  The student may
pronounce both in the same way.
`,


"č': č'əɬ":
`
___č'___ is something like saying __ch__ (as in __ch__ur__ch__) with
a catch in the throat at the same time.  It is sort of a combination
of ___č___ and ___ʔ___.  There is no sound like it in English.

"gʷat əw'ə ti stubš ʔal tiʔaʔ.":
`
**Grammar Notes 3.8 - 3.10**

__3.8__ _ti_ has a different range of meanings in accord with the
variety of Lushootseed being spoken.  In the north it means _the particular (one)_,
a sort of strong form of __te__ (the).  In Southern Lushootseed _ti_ means _this_.

__3.9__ _tiʔəʔ_ (_this_) is spoken only in Northern Lushootseed.   The
southern groups say _ti_ in place of _tiʔəʔ_.

`
_gʷat əw'ə tiʔiɬ stubš ʔal tudiʔ._


**Grammar Note 3.4a**

___tiʔiɬ___

In English the word _that_ can either stand on its own as in

  - _Give me that_

or it can MODIFY (that is, go with) the name for a
person o thing as in

  - _Give me that book_.

The word ___tiʔiɬ___ in Lushootseed functions the same way.
When it modifies (goes with) the word or person, it proceeds as in English, e.g.,

  - tiʔiɬ stubš (that man)

Sentences like

  - sqigʷəc tiʔiɬ
  - diɬ dbad tiʔiɬ

are literally translated as

  - It is a deer, that
  - He is my father, that (one)

In the sentences where _tiʔiɬ_ follows, it is NOT modifying
_sqigʷəc_ or _dbad_ but rather adding more emphasis to the statement.

It is possible to reply by omitting _tiʔiɬ_ saying

  - sqigʷəc.  It is a deer.
  - dbad.  He is my father.
`,


"diɬ dbad tiʔiɬ.":
`
**footnote 1, page 10**: <br>

Some people prefer to say
  - _dbad tiʔiɬ stubš_
  - (He is) my father, that man,
  - i.e., 'He is my father'.

Such a sentence is parallel to the type already
learned, e.g.,
  - _sqigʷəc tiʔiɬ_: It is a deer, that.

The student should use which sentence the teacher prefers,
   - _diɬ dbad tiʔiɬ_ or
   - _dbad tiʔiɬ stubš_

"xʷudad":
`
_xʷudad_

Actually, this word is spelled _xʷ(h)udad_, bu the __h__ (in this particular
case, to be explained later) is silent and can be omitted for
purposes of sound drill' (___šxʷ(h)udad___ in Southern Lushootseed means _firepit_.)

"q: ?uqada tə dqəqsiʔ ʔə tə qəlx̌.":
`
___q___

The sound representeed by this letter is not known in English.
It is something like the English __k__ but pronounced rather back in the mouth.
Listen to the teacher (or recording) carefully.  The following may help the student
master this sound: With finger against the top of the tongue, gently push it back
while trying to say __Kay__.  This should produced the sound ___qi___ (_qa_), the first part
of the word for __deer__.
`,


"ɬ: ɬuɬaɬlil čəɬ ʔi tsiʔiɬ sɬaɬədəyʔ ʔal tudiʔ.":
`
___ɬ___


There is no sound similar to ___ɬ___ in English.  It is made by placing the tongue
in the same places as if to say __la__ but the vocal cords do not move.  The air
passes around the side(s) of the tongue.

If the English word __clay__is draw out at the beginning, ___ɬ___ is heard between the ___c-___
and the ___-lay___.  It sounds something like a lateral lisp.  Some students find it helpful
to think of it as being ___lh___pronounced together.
`,

"stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ.":
`
___stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ___

Footnote 2.

In slow, deliberate speech, _əw'ə_ is prononoucned _haw'əʔ_.  It is spelled
here to represent the way it is often said in relaxed talking.

Imitate whatever pronunciation the teacher uses regardless of how it is written here.

The ' over the w indicates a slight tightening of the throat while the
word is being said.  However, this is one of the few places where such
tightening may be omitted without causing misunderstanding.

Lushootseed, unlike most languages in the world, has no word for _is_.  This absence may
seem strange at first, but the student quickly learns how unnecessary it is.

English has no word exaclty like _əw'ə_ (_haw'əʔ_).  It often adds a feeling
of wonder, and sometimes surprise, to a question.  The English words _could ...be_
are not an exact translation, but only an attempt to express the flavor of the
Lushootseed sentecne.

It is possible to omit the _əw'ə_ and say simply _stab tiʔiɬ_.

In later lessons (18.1) it will be learned that _əw'ə_ can add still other feelings to a sentence.

`,

"sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ.":
`
__sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ__

__sʔuladxʷ__ is used by the Skagit and Snohomish.  The other groups say __sčədadxʷ__
 for salmon (and seagoing trout - both anadromous fish):

__Note__: five species of Northwest anadramous fish (salmon, steelhead, and certain
bull trout)  migrate from
freshwater rivers to the ocean and back to spawn in their natal
streams. These populations of fish play an integral role in the
wildlife community as bears, otters, eagles, and many others feast on
salmon carcasses as a main source of protein when other food is
scarce.

Pacific salmonid populations truly are a "gift from the sea" as they
bring nutrients from the marine environment back to the river and
terrestrial ecosytem. As well as a significant food source for other
fish and wildlife, the life cycle of various anadromous salmon stocks
facilitates the transport of key marine-derived nutrients like carbon,
nitrogen and phosphorus to PNW forests, lakes, rivers and streams.
