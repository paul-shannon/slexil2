Grammar Note 3.4a

___tiʔiɬ___

In English the word _that_ can either stand on its own as in

  - _Give me that_

or it can MODIFY (that is, go with) the name for a
person of thing as in

  - _Give me that book_.

The word ___tiʔiɬ___ in Lushootseed functions the same way.
When it modifies (goes with) the word or person, it proceeds as in English, e.g.,

  - tiʔiɬ stubš (that man)

Sentences like

  - sqigʷəc tiʔiɬ
  - diɬ dbad tiʔiɬ

are literally translated as

  - It is a deer, that
  - He is my father, that (one)

In the sentences where _tiʔiɬ_ follows, it is NOT modifying
_sqigʷəc_ or _dbad_ but rather adding more emphasis to the statement.

It is possible to reply by omitting _tiʔiɬ_ saying

  - sqigʷəc.  It is a deer.
  - dbad.  He is my father.
`,


"diɬ dbad tiʔiɬ.":
`
Some people prefer to say
  - _dbad tiʔiɬ stubš_
  - (He is) my father, that man,
  - i.e., 'He is my father'.

Such a sentence is parallel to the type already
learned, e.g.,
  - _sqigʷəc tiʔiɬ_: It is a deer, that.

The student should use which sentence the teacher prefers,
   - _diɬ dbad tiʔiɬ_ or
   - _dbad tiʔiɬ stubš_

"stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ ʔal tə stuləkʷ.":
`
___ʔal___ refers to _location_ in a general way.  It is
commonly translated by _in_, _on_, _at_ or _of_.

"stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ diʔayucid ʔal tə šəgʷɬ.":
`
___ay___ sounds like _i_ in the English word _mind_.

"stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ ʔal tə šəgʷɬ.":
`
___š___ is like _sh_ in _shoe_.
`,

"gʷat əw'ə tiʔiɬ č'ač'as ʔal tudiʔ.":
`
Sound and Symbol 3.1   

___č'___ is something like saying __ch__ (as in __ch__ur__ch__) with
a catch in the throat at the same time.  It is sort of a combination
of ___č___ and ___ʔ___.  There is no sound like it in English.
`,


"xʷudad":
`
_xʷudad_

Actually, this word is spelled _xʷ(h)udad_, bu the __h__ (in this particular
cse to be explained later) is silent and can be omitted for
purposes of sound drill' (___šxʷ(h)udad___ in Southern Lushootseed means _firepit_.)
`,

"xʷ: ʔuxʷit'il tə sxʷət dxʷal tə xʷudad.":
`
___xʷ___

is something like _wh_ in English _where_ and _who_ but it has a slightly
more raspy quality.
`,


"q: ?uqada tə dqəqsiʔ ʔə tə qəlx̌.":
`
___q___

The sound representeed by this letter is not known in English.
It is something like the English __k__ but pronounced rather back in the mouth.
Listen to the teacher (or recording) carefully.  The following may help the student
master this sound: With finger against the top of the tongue, gently push it back
while trying to say __Kay__.  This should produced the sound ___qi___ (_qa_), the first part
of the word for __deer__.
`,


"ɬ: ɬuɬaɬlil čəɬ ʔi tsiʔiɬ sɬaɬədəyʔ ʔal tudiʔ.":
`
___ɬ___


There is no sound similar to ___ɬ___ in English.  It is made by placing the tongue
in the same places as if to say __la__ but the vocal cords do not move.  The air
passes around the side(s) of the tongue.

If the English word __clay__is draw out at the beginning, ___ɬ___ is heard between the ___c-___
and the ___-lay___.  It sounds something like a lateral lisp.  Some students find it helpful
to think of it as being ___lh___pronounced together.
`,

"stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ.":
`
___stab əw'ə tiʔiɬ___

Footnote 2.

In slow, deliberate speech, _əw'ə_ is prononoucned _haw'əʔ_ (howʔ-wuʔ).  It is spelled
here to represent the way it is often said in relaxed talking.

Imitate whatever pronunciation the teacher uses regardless of how it is written here.

The ' over the w indicates a slight tightening of the throat while the
word is being said.  However, this is one of the few places where such
tightening may be omitted without causing misunderstanding.

Lushootseed, unlike most languages in the world, has no word for _is_.  This absence may
seem strange at first, but the student quickly learns how unnecessary it is.

English has no word exaclty like _əw'ə_ (_haw'əʔ_).  It often adds a feeling
of wonder, and sometimes surprise, to a question.  The English words _could ...be_
are not an exact translation, but only an attempt to express the flavor of the
Lushootseed sentecne.

It is possible to omit the _əw'ə_ and say simply _stab tiʔiɬ_.

In later lessons (18.1) it will be learned that _əw'ə_ can add still other feelings to a sentence.

"spaʔc tiʔiɬ":
`
___spaʔc tiʔiɬ___

Footnote 3.

Notice that the a literal translation is

"(A) bear that (is)."

Only the Skagit say _spaʔc_.  All other Puget Sound groups say ___sčətxʷəd___ (schut-whud) for bear.
`,

"sqigʷəc tiʔiɬ.":
`
___sqigʷəc tiʔiɬ___

Footnote 4.

The teacher may wish to substitute the word __kʷagʷičə__ (_kwah-gwee-chud_)
_elk_ for __sqigʷəc__ _deer_ thereby avoiding till a later lesson the sound "q".
`,

"sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ.":
`
__sʔuladxʷ tiʔiɬ__

__sʔuladxʷ__ is used by the Skagit and Snohomish.  The other groups say __sčədadxʷ__
(scyu-day-dwh) for salmon (and seagoing trout - both anadromous fish):

__Note__: five species of Northwest anadramous fish (salmon, steelhead, and certain
bull trout)  migrate from
freshwater rivers to the ocean and back to spawn in their natal
streams. These populations of fish play an integral role in the
wildlife community as bears, otters, eagles, and many others feast on
salmon carcasses as a main source of protein when other food is
scarce.

Pacific salmonid populations truly are a "gift from the sea" as they
bring nutrients from the marine environment back to the river and
terrestrial ecosytem. As well as a significant food source for other
fish and wildlife, the life cycle of various anadromous salmon stocks
facilitates the transport of key marine-derived nutrients like carbon,
nitrogen and phosphorus to PNW forests, lakes, rivers and streams.

__bəščəb tiʔiɬ__
