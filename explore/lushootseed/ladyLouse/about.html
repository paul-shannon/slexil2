<h4>Lady Louse</h4>

This video recording resides at United States  National Archives.

The transcription, translation, and morphemic analysis is drawn, with
very slight modifications, from Beck and Hess 2015, <i>Tellings from Our
Elders, volume I, Snohomish Texts</i>, pages 513-518, as told in two
versions by Elizabeth Krise.

This note accompanies the transcription:
<blockquote>
Recorded by Tom Hess, August 1962, at Tulalip, WA; transcribed by Thom
Hess, further redaction by Thom Hess.  The story is recorded twice in
succession on the tape; a "complete" version of the story was created
at a later date for pedagogical purposes largely by amalgamating line
6 of the first version into the second.  This version was popularized
by Vi Taqʷšəblu Hilbert and published as part of <i>Lady Louse Lived
There</i> (Hilbert, 1996, Lushootseed Press).
