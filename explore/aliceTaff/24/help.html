<h3> Some Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <p><li> Close this "tips" window by clicking on the background.
  <p><li> Start and stop continuous playback with the media player's controls.
  <p><li> Play a single line by clicking on that line's "speaker" icon.
  <p><li> For video converastions, Picture-in-picture will be useful to some.  This puts the video
  in a separate window, after which you can shrink the originating window in your web browser,
		allowing more text to be seen on-screen.
		<p><li> Safari on a Mac laptop, iPhone or iPad sometimes produces odd results in single line
			 mode.
