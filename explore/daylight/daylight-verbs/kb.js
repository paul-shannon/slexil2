middle applicative<br>
"middle" a grammatical voice, along with active and passive:
<ul>
   <li> active: the subject is the agent or doer of the action
        Joe cooked the meal.
   <li> passive: the subject is the patient, target, or undergoer
        The meal was cooked by Joe.
   <li> middle: the subject both performs and receives the action.
        The meal cooked in the oven.
</ul>
<pre>
...a particular type of diathesis alternation known as the middle. The
most salient property of a middle is that the internal argument of the
verb appears as the subject of the construction, as in a passive. The
semantics of a middle differs from that of passives in that middles
cannot be episodic, but are generic statements about the subject.
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom091" target="_blank">ref</a>.


The secondary suffix <i>-bi-</i> middle applicative [MAP], combines with the
internal causative suffix <i>-t</i> to form transitive stems whose
direct object expresses semantic actants in a variety of roles other
than PATIENT. The range of semantic roles, and to a certain extent the
syntactic effect of -bi-d on its stem, is much more variable than it
is for -yi-d, and the over-arching semantic linkage amongst the
different uses of this morphological complex seems to be a rather
abstract notion of reduced semantic transitivity (Hopper & Thompson
1980), a notion identified by Kemmer (1993) as being the common thread
linking middle forms across a wide range of languages. The parallel is
strengthened by the overlap in semantic domain with the
valency-neutral middle -b in Lushootseed and the cognate -m and -mi
suffixes in other Salishan languages, elements which also cluster in
their meanings around the prototypical meanings of the middle.

**subjunctive**: a grammatical mood (that is, a way of
speaking that allows people to express their attitude toward what they
are saying) found in many languages. Subjunctive forms of verbs are
typically used to express various states of unreality such as wish,
emotion, possibility, judgement, opinion, obligation, or action that
have not yet occurred; the precise situations in which they are used
vary from language to language. The subjunctive is an irrealis mood
(one that does not refer directly to what is necessarily real) – it is
often contrasted with the indicative, which is a realis mood (used
principally to indicate that something is a statement of fact).

     - In linguistics and philosophy, **modality** is the phenomenon whereby language is used to discuss possible

       understanding of the speaker's meaning:
          - Tense, the location in time relative to the speaker, to the time of utterance, to the time of action
	    or requested action, or stated exactly.
          - Aspect, whether the action is complete (perfect) or continuous (imperfect) and repetitive.
          - Mood or Modality, the degree of obligation. Was the part of speech intended to be informative, to be a
            request, a demand, or an expectation.
          - For example in English the word "walk" would be used in different ways for the different
            combinations of TAM:
               - Tense: He will walk tomorrow, He walked yesterday, He walks or is walking now.
               - Aspect: He walks (every day), will walk tomorrow, he'll be walking (around noontime
	         tomorrow), is still walking (now) and has been walking (earlier).
               - Mode: I can walk. You there! Walk!

From David Beck (email 20 nov 2021)

Literally, it would be glossed as “its habitual getting light again
[was] for a long time, and it would again get dark”.

The sentence consists of two clauses joined by gʷəl ‘and’. The first
one has no verb and the predicate of the sentence is an adverb hagʷ
‘long time’ and the subject is a nominalized form of our favourite
word, sləx̌il.

sləx̌il is what we call in the business an impersonal [avalent] verb which
doesn’t have any real Agent or Actor to be the subject, so the subject
of any clause with sləx̌il is like the English “it” in “it is
raining”—an “empty” (i.e., meaningless) third-person. When you
nominalize a verb in Lushootseed, you need to express what would have
been the subject as a possessor, so here the =s is just a grammatical
expression of that empty third person. The subject of the second
sentence is also that, but since it is not nominalized, we have a
finite clause with a Ø (elided) pronoun.

       It forms a very large class of agent-oriented intransitive verb
       stems and a number of ambient stems such as *qəl-b* 'rain'.
     - With lexial stems it designates middle voice and in construction
       with *dxʷ(s)-* and *ʔəʷ(s)* it creates a desiderative stem.
     - _desiderative_: (of a verb derived from another verb) expressing desire to perform
        the action denoted by the underlying verb, as Sanskrit pi-patiṣ-ati “he wishes to fly”
        from pát-ati, “he flies.”
     - This *-b* is a component in a number of derivational suffixes
       as well, and combines with transitive suffixes to form a passive
       construction: *-təb*,  *-du-b*, *-tu-b*, *c-əb*, and *-s-əb*

I asked David (email, 2 sep 2020): could you offer me some guidance on what “expected direct
complement patient lacks a demonstrative” means?.

Thom Hess didn’t like the terms “subject” and “object” because he thought they were too “English”
oriented. What he means by “direct complement” is either the subject or the direct object—that is, a
noun that accompanies a verb without a preposition in front of it.

_ʔuʔux̌ʷ ti     č’ač’as_     (direct complement = subject)
go        the  boy
'the boy goes'

_kʷədad ti      sʔuladxʷ_       (direct complement = direct object)
take      the  salmon
’s/he/they take the salmon'

_ʔəɬəd  ʔə  ti     sʔuladx̌_        (oblique complement)
eat       of   the  salmon
’s/he/they eat the salmon'

Direct complements, or noun phrases in general, normally have demonstratives or determiners like
“ti”, “tiʔiɬ”, etc., in front of them. However, there are a couple of verbs that can have nouns
without a demonstrative, like this čəɬ. So it is okay to say something like

_čəɬ 		ƛ’əlayʔ_
make	canoe
’make canoes/a canoe/canoes in general’

You can also say 

_čəɬ 		ti	ƛ’əlayʔ_
make	ti	canoe

but then you’re saying something more like ‘make that canoe/the canoe we were talking
about/particular canoes’. That is why it is sometimes thought of as “incorporation” by analogy with
languages that will join nouns and verbs together to make words that describe activities involving
the type of noun (kind of like English “duck-hunting”, except you’d get a verb “to duck-hunt”).

Anyway, the key here is that there are only a couple of verbs like čəɬ in Lushootseed that allow you
to use a noun like this without a demonstrative.

- Lexical suffixes
    - Lexical affixes (or semantic affixes) are bound elements that appear as affixes, but
      function as **incorporated nouns** within verbs and as elements of nouns. They are similar
      to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although
      similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as
      freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.
    - Lexical affixes are relatively rare. The Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages all 
      have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest
      of North America.  The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance
      to free nouns with similar meanings.
    - In this sense, they are unlike what is usually perceived as derivational affixes, which
      more often have little concrete meaning, rather serving to identify lexical classes.
    - Lexical suffixes have gone by several names. Sapir described them, rather than naming them, and
      called them ''verbal affixes that refer to nouns" (1911:251/1989 [1990]:28);
    - Reichard called them "nominal suffixes" (1938:601),
    - Vogt used the term "field-suffixes" (1940:58), and Kuipers divided them into "somatic suffixes"
      (1967:120) and "non-somatic suffixes" (1967:125).
    - The usage "1exical suffixes" was first used by Kinkade (1963:352), adopted from Vogt, who used this
      term, rather, for "a group of suffixes which modify the verb, by changing its
      syntactical functions or by adding various shades of meaning, as iteration,
      reciprocity, reflexivity etc."  (1940:56).
    - Kinkade made the change because of the semantic similarity between these suffixes and usual lexical
      items (i.e. nouns). The term is now in  general use in discussing this class of affix in Salish,
      Chemakuan, and Wakashan studies.
    - A small number of prefixes found in some Salishan languages are often referred to as
      "lexical prefixes", probably developed by analogy with lexical suffixes; I will not deal with
      these prefixes here.

    * does not belong to one of the main classes of words
    * is invariable in form
    * typically has grammatical or pragmatic meaning.
    * The usage of the term particle varies. Some authorities include English prepositions 
      and even articles as particles.
- In English, particle  is a somewhat nebulous term for a variety of small words that 
  do not conveniently fit into other classes of words. The Concise Oxford Companion to the 
  English Language defines a particle as a "word that does not change its form through 
  inflection and does not fit easily into the established system of parts of speech".
  The term includes _adverbial particles_ like _up_ or _out_ in verbal idioms (phrasal verbs) 
  such as _look up_ or _knock out_.  It is also used to include the "infinitival particle" _to_, 
  the "negative particle" _not_, the "imperative particles" _do_ and _let_, and sometimes 
  "pragmatic particles" like _oh_ and _well_.  Another example is the word _so_ in the adverb _so far_.

#### Root Semantics: from Davis and Matthewson: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1749-818X.2009.00145.x">Issues in Salish Syntax and Semantics</a>

Salish languages are of interest for the investigation of decompositional theories of verb meaning,
since to a much greater extent than in European languages, Salish verbs wear their derivational
structure on their sleeves. 

footnote: We assume a three-way lexical category distinction between nouns, adjectives, and verbs,
and focus here exclusively on the last. The issue of category neutrality in Salish has been the
subject of intense debate, but the debate has largely now been settled in favor of recognizing at
least a noun-verb distinction and probably an adjective-verb distinction as well.

A Salish verb typically consists of the following elements (excluding inflectional morphemes such 
as person marking, and passive, reciprocal and reflexive suffixes):

  - a root (distinguishable as the domain of various morphophonological processes, including infixation 
    and several types of reduplication).

 - some form of aspectual marking, which may be either prefixal (e.g., reflexes of the
   pan-Salish stative prefix _ʔac-), infixal (e.g., the Interior Salish inchoative infix _-ʔ–),
   suffixal (e.g., the Interior Salish inchoative suffix _–p_), reduplicative (e.g., Central
   Salish ‘inceptive’ CV-reduplication) or a mixture of these (e.g., Central Salish ‘actual’
   (imperfective) morphology).

 - zero or more lexical suffixes, substantive elements with root-like meanings which modify the
   root in various ways, but do not generally affect valence, aspect, or argument structure.

 - a transitivizing or intransitive suffix; almost without exception throughout Salish, transitive
   verbs (those which take object suffixes) must be suffixed with a transitivizer; intransitive
   verbs fall into both suffixed and unsuffixed types. Transitivity is linked to both aspect and
   agent control: the latter notion refers to the ability of an agent to influence the outcome of an
   event (Thompson 1979, 1985).  Of these four basic ingredients, only the root is essential: every
   Salish language has at least some ‘bare root’ verbs. However, bare root verbs are always in the
   minority; the majority of verb roots for any given Salish language are obligatorily affixed with
   one or more of the elements in (ii–iv) above to form a complex verb stem.  `,

"Grammar Notes":
`
#### Lexical suffixes: from Kinkade <a href="https://lingpapers.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2018/03/1998_Kinkade.pdf" target=_blank>Origins of Salishan Lexical Suffixes</a>

   Lexical suffixes are a group of suffixes found in Salish, Chemakuan, and Wakashan which have semantic content
   analogous to specific nouns, but lack phonological similarity to them. In this sense, they are unlike what is usually
   perceived as derivational affixes, which more often have little concrete meaning, rather serving to identify lexical
   classes. Lexical suffixes have gone by several names: Sapir described them, rather than naming them, and called them
   ''verbal affixes that refer to nouns" (1911:251/1989 [1990]:28); Reichard called them "nominal suffixes" (1938:601),
   Vogt used the term "field-suffixes" (1940:58), and Kuipers divided them into "somatic suffixes" (1967:120) and
   "non-somatic suffixes" (1967:125). The usage "1exical suffixes" was first used by Kinkade (1963:352), adopted from
   Vogt, who used this term, rather, for "a group of suffixes which modify the verb, by changing its syntactical
   functions or by adding various shades of meaning, as iteration, reciprocity, reflexivity etc." (1940:56).  Kinkade
   made the change because of the semantic similarity between these suffixes and usual lexical items (i.e. nouns). The
   term is now in general use in discussing this class of affix in Salish, Chemakuan, and Wakashan studies. A small
   number of prefixes found in some Salishan languages are often referred to as "lexical prefixes", probably developed
   by analogy with lexical suffixes; I will not deal with these prefixes here.

#### Nominalizers s= and dəxʷ= (email from David Beck, 12 jan 2020)

Grasping the difference between _s=_ and _dəxʷ=_ is a subtle and essential point of the grammar for aficionados. 
If it helps, you can think of it in terms of the argument structure of a verb. If you think about a verb like 
CUT in a sentence like “The boy cut salmon with a knife in the longhouse”, we can describe _cut_ in terms of a 
lexicographical definition:

CUT:  ‘X divides Y into pieces with Z’

Each variable corresponds to an entity (participant in the event). X and Y are (in English and Lushootseed) 
obligatory and realized as subject and direct object, respectively. We call these “core arguments” or 
“direct complements" in Salishan studies. Z is optional (it has to be part of the definition because you can’t 
CUT without an instrument—we would use a different verb for that), so is called an "oblique object." In the 
sentence I gave you, there is another entity, the longhouse, which is completely optional. We call that an “adjunct” 
(mainly for historical reasons having to do with those strange trees you stumbled across). Adjuncts are typically 
locations, times, motives, and other adverbial “extras”.  [i.e., they are structurally dispensable, is not an argument]

Once you have those terms, you can start to figure out (bit by bit) the pattern in relative clauses and gerunds:

A relative clause—also called an adjective or adjectival clause—will meet three requirements.

First, it will contain a subject and verb.
Next, it will begin with a relative pronoun [who, whom, whose, that, or which] or a relative adverb [when, where, or why].
Finally, it will function as an adjective, answering the questions What kind? How many? or Which one?)

A relative clause can be formed on a subject or (non-third person) direct object without _s=_:

  -  _ʔučalad čəd ti sqʷəbayʔ_  &nbsp;   ==>  _ʔəca ti ʔučalad ti sq̌əbayʔ_
      I chased the dog          &nbsp;   ==>    the one who chased the dog [is] I

  -  _ʔučalad čəd ti sqʷəbayʔ_  &nbsp;  ==>  _sq̌əbayʔ ti ʔučalad čəd_
      I chased the dog          &nbsp;  ==>  the one I chased [is] the dog

These are the only true relative clauses (“finite” clauses used as or to modify a noun) in Lushootseed.
(Finite clauses must contain a verb which shows tense. Non-finite clauses do not, with time inferred from the main clause.)

The equivalent of an English relative clause is one of those gerund-like things formed on an oblique object with _s=_:

  - _ʔuʔəɬəd čəxʷ ti sʔuladxʷ_  ==>  _sʔuladxʷ ti adsuʔəɬəd_
     You ate the salmon    &nbsp; &nbsp;  your eaten one [is] the salmon

Note that this is equivalency in function, not structure, since this is structurally more like a gerund.

A "relative clause”/gerund formed on an adjunct needs _dəxʷ=_

  - _ʔud ubalikʷ čəɬ ʔalʔalʔal_   ==>  _ʔalʔal ti dəxʷud ubalikʷ čəɬ_
     we danced in the house  &nbsp; &nbsp;          the place of our dancing [is] the house

Again, this is really a kind of nominalization like a gerund, but is used where English would just use a 
relative clause. The neat thing about these gerunds is that you essentially get nouns with complex meanings, 
like _dəxʷ=lə=saxʷəb•abac=s_ which would be either the place where, time when or the reason they were jumping
over the bodies.

There also another kind of gerund with s=, which creates a nominalized expression of the whole event:

   - _ʔučalad čəd ti sqʷəbayʔ_   ==>  _dsučalad ti sq̌əbayʔ_
     I chased the dog &nbsp; &nbsp; my chasing of the dog

The difference here is that the expression refers to the event and not a participant in the event the way the
relative clause does. An expression like _ti adsuʔəɬəd_ above is actually potentially ambiguous, it could mean 
either “your eaten one” or “your eating it”. However, context usually makes it clear and I suspect (could be wrong) 
that it would be uncommon not to have the object specified in the gerund - so, you would expect 

   - _adsuʔəɬəd ti sʔuladxʷ_ ‘your eating the salmon’ 

or something like that if the event-nominalization reading was intended.

### Prototypes

 1. simple:  comment(topic) 
    _tuhuyucutəxʷ (tiʔəʔ səsaliʔ ləgʷləgʷəb)_
    David Beck (email 2 jan 2020): this is the simplest clause, an intransitive verb with a nominal subject. 
    The noun is quantified/modified by a numeral. That’s really the parent class of all the other clause structures; 
    all the properties of that structure are inherited by every other clause type.

 2. simpler: comment(implied topic)
    tuc’agʷacutəxʷ
 3. and-fronted topic: topic gʷəl predicate
    _ʔaʔ kʷi sləx̌il ʔal kʷi q’xʷul’gʷədxʷ gʷəl ʔəsčal kʷi gʷədəxʷkʷədxʷ čəɬ_

 

#### Concerning predicates, David Beck (email 24 dec 2019) 

You might look at it in terms of what Edward Sapir termed “topic” and “comment” (though these aren’t
exactly the same thing, they just align nicely here). Sapir said that a sentence has two parts,
something that is being discussed (the topic) and something that is being said about it (the
comment). A sentence like

   - _tiʔəʔ qaw'qs ʔi tiʔəʔ bibščəb kʷi tuhuyucut_
       

is about “the ones who prepare themselves” (you would say it in a context where you’ve been
discussing an event and that someone is training for it) and what you’re saying about “the ones” is
that they are Mink and Raven (so you probably say this sentence to someone who knows there are
people training but doesn’t know that the people training are Mink and Raven).

   - The ones who prepare themselves are Mink and Raven
   - sentence topic: _the ones who prepare themselves_
   - sentence comment: _they are Mink and Raven_
   - thus
       - syntactic predicate: they are Mink and Raven
       - syntactic subject:  the ones who prepare themselves
       - predicate always comes first
       - subject always comes second

The comment (what you are saying about X) is a predicate in the sense that the comment attributes
some property (membership in a class) to X in the same way that a predicate asserts class membership
to a term. Sentence (9) asserts that the people training belong to the class of “Mink and
Raven”. That’s an odd way of going about it from an English point of view, but the English sentence
above does the same thing, and is grammatical, if a bit stilted.

In this kind of Lushootseed sentence, the sentence comment is always the syntactic predicate, and
always comes first. The sentence topic is always the subject and comes second. What is jarring for
English speaker, other than the order of words, is the absence of a copular “be” verb.

#### Topic and comment

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_and_comment" target=_blank>Wikipedia</a> 
The topic, or theme, of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the comment (rheme or focus)
is what is being said about the topic. This division into old vs. new content is called information
structure. It is generally agreed that clauses are divided into topic vs. comment, but in certain
cases the boundary between them depends on which specific grammatical theory is being used to
analyze the sentence.

Topic, which is defined by pragmatic considerations, is a distinct concept from grammatical subject,
which is defined by syntax. In any given sentence these may be the same, but they need not be. For
example, in the sentence "As for the little girl, the dog bit her", the subject is "the dog" but the
topic is "the little girl".

Topic and subject are also distinct concepts from agent (or actor)—the "doer", which is defined by
semantics. In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically
the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition by. For example, in the
sentence "The little girl was bitten by the dog", "the little girl" is the subject and the topic,
but "the dog" is the agent.

In some languages, word order and other syntactic phenomena are determined largely by the
topic–comment (theme–rheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as topic-prominent
languages. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.

##### I then asked David:

Topic and comment - very helpful.  I also found topic characterized as “the old” in information
structure, and comment as “the new” - reasonable?

##### He replied:

No, “old” (a.k.a. Given) information is not exactly the same. Topics are usually old/Given, but not
always. Not everything that is old/Given in the discourse is the topic of a particular sentence,
either. People get these confused a lot.

Comments are usually new information, but not always. For instance, in the context of the Harry
Moses story, Raven and Little Mink are old/Given by line 9, but they are the Comment in this
sentence.

But do keep in mind that Comment and Topic are linked to predicate and subject, respectively, much
more rigidly in Lushootseed than they are in most languages. So this is a cheat we can use for this
language



#### Kroeber: Clause Structure (p36)

...define *transitive*, *intransitive*, *subject*, *object*, and *oblique* in terms of predicate
morphology.  A clause is transitive if its predicate contains a transitive or ditransitive
marker, an object pronomial [or a few other special cases]. Otherwise a clause is intransitive.
Clauses whose predicate is reflexive or reciprocal (1.3.6) will also be regarded as intransitive.

*Subject* will refer to nominal expressions cross-referenced with a subject pronomial on the clause
predicate; *object* to nominal expressions cross-referenced by an object pronomial (including the
zero third person marker); *oblique* to nonimals not corss-referenced by a pronomial on the clause
predicate.

In all Salish languages, the predicate is most often clause initial, followed by nominal expressions
and prepositional phrases coding participants in the event.  Subject and object are grouped together
as direct participants.  There are various options for placing participant expresssions in
prepredicate position (see chapter 7). [Kroeber, p37].

I group subject and object together as DIRECT participants.  Other sorts of participants - those not
registered as by pronomial paradigms on the predicate - are OBLIQUE.  In general, obliques are represented
by prepositional phrases, while subject and object are represented by nominal expressions without 
preposition. [Kroeber, p38].

#### Tense and Aspect (LR-1 p49)

Tense, that is to say, present past and future, is forced upon speakers of English by the grammar.  Every 
sentence must be expressed in one of these categories because tense in English is obligatory:  an event
is always located before, after or during the moment of speaking, or with reference to another event.

Lushootseed instead emphasizes aspect - the period of time within an event or process occurs, and
not when it occured.  Examples of (optional) English aspect: _is going_ vs. _has gone_ vs. _went_;
_beat_ (repetitive) vs.  _hit_ (momentaneous).  Some are formed with phrases like _burst into tears_, 
_cry by fits and starts_, and _do over and over_.  Thus aspect addresses the lapse of time in which 
the act is done.

Lushootseed verbs are either static (with the prefix ***ʔəs-***) or dynamic:

- perfective:  often with ***ʔu-***, viewed as a single whole w/o regard to phases or parts of the event
- imperfective: ***lə-*** (progressive), ***ləs-*** (progressive state), ***ləcu-*** (continuous)

#### Constituents of the clause (parts of the sentence): Lushootseed Reader Volume 1, Lesson 16, p. 81

Some Lushootseed sentences have no verbs - a verb being a stem which carries or could carry one of the five aspectual
prefixes described just above.

1. <i><u>ɬubəščəb</u> tiʔiɬ</i> :  &nbsp; &nbsp; That one <u>will become a mink</u>.
2. <i><u>tusiʔab</u> ti tudsč'istxʷ</i> : &nbsp; &nbsp; My former husband was a <u>man of rank</u>.
3. <i><u>ʔəca</u> ti tudiʔqs</i>.  &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>I am the one</u> who was on the other side of the point.
4. <i><u>saliʔ</u> tiʔəʔ sqigʷac</i>.  &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>There are two</u> deer.
5. <i><u>tiʔəʔ</u> tə dukʷibəɬ</i>.  &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Way off there</u> is Changer.

**Predicate**, underlined, refers to the position of the word, rather than its class.  Only the
predicate is essential.  The remainder of each line is the **direct complement**.  Predicate +
direct complement form the **core** of the clause.  Complements are more commonly called
**arguments**.

Peripheral components of the clause:

1. **oblique complement**
2. one or more **adjuncts**  (see wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_%28linguistics%29#Arguments_and_adjuncts" target=_blank>arguments and adjuncts</a>.
   They provide additional information that is not necessary to complete the meaning of the predicate.
3. a **locative** or **temporal** augment

####Adjunct#####
- An adjunct is an optional, or structurally dispensable, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that,
  if removed or discarded, will not otherwise affect the remainder of the sentence. Example: In the
  sentence John helped Bill in Central Park, the phrase in Central Park is an adjunct.
- A more detailed definition of the adjunct emphasizes its attribute as a modifying form, word, or
  phrase that depends on another form, word, or phrase, being an element of clause structure with
  adverbial function.  An adjunct is not an argument (nor is it a predicative expression), and an
  argument is not an adjunct.


####Oblique Complements####
Agents of the predicate, "coded in some special way" - in Lushootseed, introduced by _ʔə_.

Thom Hess: That part of the clause which 

1. expresses the agent of predicates ending in  _-t-əb_  _-du-b_  _-tu-b_  _-c-əb_ or  _-s-əb_.
2. always introduced by _ʔə_ 

   _ʔukʷədatəb   ʔə tiʔəʔ pišpiš  ti sʔuladxʷ_.   
   The cat took the salmon.
   (predicate)  
   (oblique complement: subject)  
   (direct complement: object)


From p22:

- _ʔuʔusil ti c'ix̌c'ix̌_.   &nbsp; The fish hawk dove.  (predicate) (direct complement: subject)
- _ʔuʔusis ti sʔuladxʷ_.  &nbsp;  [It] dove after a salmon. (predicate) (direct complement: object)
- _ʔuʔusisəb ʔə ti c'ix̌c'ix̌ ti sʔuladxʷ_. &nbsp; The fish hawk dove after the salmon. (predicate) (oblique complement: subject) (direct complement: object)

####Augments####
LR.1 p82: Single words within the clause which express locative or temporal notions and re not part of any other
constituent in the clause.  They follow the predicate but are positionally free relative to the other constituents.

_tuləʔibəš tiʔiɬ bəščəb <u>liɬʔilgʷiɬ</u>._  &nbsp; &nbsp; Mink was travelling <u>along the shore</u>.
_ʔuɬəx̌təb <u>dxʷt'aq't</u> dxʷʔal tudiʔ ʔalʔal._  It was spread <u>up</u> toward yonder house.

####Adjunct####
Whatever remains in the clause is termed the adjundct.  If a word or phrase is not (part of) the predicate,
direct complement, oblique complement or augment, it is (part of) an adjunct.

#### David Beck's "Semantic agents, syntactic subjects, and discourse topics####

How to locate Lushootseed sentences in space and time." [link] (https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dbeck/LSubjects.pdf)



Oblique participants are those not registered by pronomial paradigms on the predicate.  The term
oblique is often used to refer to the grammatical relation of arguments or adjuncts that are coded
in some special way (by means of an adposition or a semantic case), contrasting with core arguments,
which are generally coded without case-marking or with grammatical case-marking.

***oblique complement:*** a phrase accompanying a predicate, naming an entity in addition to the
basic agent/patient relations usually associated with that relation and introduced by a particle.

***adjunct***:  a phrase adding information to a sentence beyond the agent/patient relations associated
with the predication, typically involving manner, instrument, benefactive, or location in time
or space. LD xviii


An adjunct is a word, phrase, or clause - usually, an adverbial - that is integrated within the
structure of a sentence or clause (unlike a disjunct, e.g. "hopefully" ) and yet can be omitted
without making the sentence ungrammatical.

In the sentence _On Monday Maria sent a letter to her mother by e-mail_, the three prepositional
phrases on Monday, to her mother, and by e-mail would be considered obliques by many linguists. Note
that on Monday and by e-mail are adjuncts, while to her mother is an argument; typically the term
oblique is neutral with respect to the adjunct-argument distinction and is defined by the coding
patterns.

"‘In the distant past, there was no daylight.’":

- temporal prepositional phrase: in the distant past

- syntactic expletive: "there" in e.g. "there was" - a pronoun that is used at the start of a
  sentence or clause when the referent is not immediately known, but an argument for the verb is
  syntactically required. The basic meaning of the clause is made explicit after the verb. Common
  forms of construction for sentences that contain a syntactic expletive begin with "it is", "here
  is", or "there is". The expletive serves as the grammatical subject of the independent clause that
  it begins. In a clause like "it is raining" the referent of the pronoun "it" is not obvious.

- sometimes called "dummy pronoun": a deictic pronoun that fulfills a syntactical requirement
  without providing a contextually explicit meaning of its referent. As such, it is an example of
  exophora [something not in the original text or discourse].

- *no*: a determiner expressing quantity (all, every, many, some, any, each, either, one, another)
  similar in meaning to "not a" or "not any"

- see "weather it"

- david beck, analyzing line 12:
    sləx̌il is what we call in the business an impersonal verb which doesn’t have any real Agent or
  Actor to be the subject, so the subject of any clause with sləx̌il is like the English “it” in “it
  is raining”—an “empty” (i.e., meaningless) third-person. When you nominalize a verb in
  Lushootseed, you need to express what would have been the subject as a possessor, so here the =s
  is just a grammatical expression of that empty third person.  The subject of the second sentence
  is also that, but since it is not nominalized, we have a finite clause with a Ø (elided) pronoun.

   - a linking verb is a verb that describes the subject by connecting it to a predicate adjective 
     or predicate noun (collectively known as subject complements). Unlike the majority of verbs, 
     they do not describe any direct action taken or controlled by the subject.
   - Linking verbs include copulas such as the English verb be and its various forms, as well as verbs
     of perception such as look, sound, or taste and some other verbs that describe the subject, such 
     as seem, become, or remain.
   - <button id="refButton" onclick="ref('COPULA');">copula</button> -  stative verbs. a word or phrase that links the subject of a phrase to a complement (which 
     describes or renames the subject).
   - The word *there* is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a dummy subject,
     normally of an intransitive verb. The "logical subject" of the verb then appears as a
     complement after the verb.
   - **dummy subject**:  _There are five Dutch people in our village_. (The real subject is the Dutch
      people – they are in the village.)
   - This use of *there* occurs most commonly with forms of the verb be in existential clauses, to refer
     to the presence or existence of something. For example: There is a heaven; There are two cups on
     the table; There have been a lot of problems lately. It can also be used with other verbs: There
     exist two major variants; There occurred a very strange incident.
   - The dummy subject takes the number (singular or plural) of the logical subject (complement),
     hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In informal English, however, the
     contraction there's is often used for both singular and plural.[14]
   - The dummy subject can undergo inversion, Is there a test today?  and Never has there been a man
     such as this. It can also appear without a corresponding logical subject, in short sentences
     and question tags: There wasn't a discussion, was there? There was.
   - The word there in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an adverb, or as a dummy
     predicate, rather than as a pronoun.[15] However, its identification as a pronoun is most
     consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and question tags as described above.

    of a number of established discontinuity types (the other three being wh-fronting, scrambling,
    and extraposition). Topicalization is also used as a constituency test; an expression that can
    be topicalized is deemed a constituent. The topicalization of arguments in English is rare,
    whereas circumstantial adjuncts are often topicalized. Most languages allow topicalization, and
    in some languages, topicalization occurs much more frequently and/or in a much less marked
    manner than in English.

  There will be some dispute about whether the noun phrase ’the bear’
  is itself the subject, or whether it is outside the clause and the
  subject is actually a “zero” third person, i.e.

    [Bear(subj) [just travel]] 

   vs.

     Bear(topic) [[just travel] Ø ‘he’]

   You see the difference in some languages which have an overt
   pronominal in these kinds of “topicalization” structures—e.g.,
   Eng. Bear, he just travels. Deciding this for Lushootseed is going
   to be largely dependant on the parameters one sets oneself for
   describing clause structure. I tend to place this kind of thing
   outside the clause (option 2 above) because it means I don’t have
   to qualify statements about the order of constituents in the clause
   (e.g., this way the verb/predicate ALWAYS precedes any nominal
   arguments).

   Using gʷəl this way is pretty much the only way to get a
   non-predicative noun phrase at the beginning of the sentence.

"tudiʔ": 
` - there, remote in time or place
  - contrast with diʔəʔ (here); compare ʔá (there). 
  - _tudiʔ_ is actually a determiner (like an article) so it indicates that the ancestors are remote
    (in time rather than space in this case), so the phrase _tudiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ_ would mean something 
    like ’those yonder former elders of ours’ (David Beck, email 16oct2019)
  - A determiner, also called determinative (abbreviated det), is a word, phrase, or affix that occurs 
    together with a noun or noun phrase and serves to express the reference of that noun or noun phrase 
    in the context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or 
    indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a 
    specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Common kinds of determiners 
    include definite and indefinite articles (like the English the and a or an), demonstratives (this and that), 
    possessive determiners (my and their), quantifiers (many, few and several), cardinal numbers, distributive 
    determiners (each, any), and interrogative determiners (which). (wikipedia)
  - An article (with the linguistic glossing abbreviation art) is a word that is used with a noun (as a 
    standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some 
    languages extending to volume or numerical scope. The articles in English grammar are _the_ and _a/an_, 
    and in certain contexts _some_. "An" and "a" are modern forms of the Old English "an", which in Anglian 
    dialects was the number "one" (compare "on" in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the 
    number "owan". Both "on" (respelled "one" by the Norman language) and "an" survived into Modern English, 
    with "one" used as the number and "an" ("a", before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an 
    indefinite article.
    In English grammar, articles are frequently considered part of a broader category called determiners, 
    which contains articles, demonstratives (such as "this" and "that"), possessive determiners (such as 
    "my" and "his"), and quantifiers (such as "all" and "few").[1] Articles and other determiners are also 
    sometimes counted as a type of adjective, since they describe the words that they precede.[2]
  - All consultants claim that tudiʔ and tadiʔ are exactly the same.

#### Discussion

email from david beck (07oct2019):

Starting out with this sentence literally in English is weird, so the translator opted for a more natural-sounding 
translation. 

- Lesson 1: beware the translation!
- Literally, the sentence says 
    _(Here) it is, you, my noble friend._ 
- _ʔa_ means what you say (be.there), maybe a bit more specifically, exist.in.a.place(X) where X is implicit in 
the context,  the story. 
- _dəgʷi siʔab dsyaʔyaʔ_ seems to be more of a vocative, not an argument of the verb.
- vocative:  a word in the vocative case, used to identify a person being addressed.
  The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who is being addressed, or to indicate to that person that he or she 
ought to be listening.

#### Discussion

David's further comments (email 16 nov 19)

regarding *ʔə tudiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ* :

of-phrases like “mother of all battles” aren’t usually considered adjectives or modifiers. They are
“possessive phrases” and in English and Lushootseed (when ʔə is used), they are “possessive
prepositional phrases”.

##### David's further comments (email 16 oct 19)

 1. _yəhub ti sluƛ’luƛ’ ʔə ti syəhub_ "the elders (subject) tell a story (oblique object)"
 2. _ti yəhub ʔə ti syəhub_ "those who tell a story (= elders)" (refers to the agent/subject)
 3. _ti syəhub ʔə ti sluƛ’luƛ’_ "the elder’s telling (= story)" (refers to the oblique object — 
     note here how s= causes the subject in 1 to become a possessor)

explanations:

 1. _ʔə tudiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ_ is a prepositional phrase, but you might note that it is a possessive 
    prepositional phrase—‘of our former elders (= our former elder’s)’
 2. Prepositions and postpositions, together called adpositions (or broadly, in English, simply prepositions),
    are a class of words used to express spatial or temporal relations (in, under, towards, before) or mark 
    various semantic roles (of, for).

 3. A preposition or postposition typically combines with a noun or pronoun, or more generally a noun phrase, 
    this being called its complement, or sometimes object. A preposition comes before its complement; a 
    postposition comes after its complement. English generally has prepositions rather than postpositions – 
    words such as in, under and of precede their objects, such as in England, under the table, of Jane – although 
    there are a few exceptions including "ago" and "notwithstanding", as in "three days ago" and "financial 
    limitations notwithstanding". Some languages that use a different word order, have postpositions instead, 
    or have both types. The phrase formed by a preposition or postposition together with its complement is 
    called a prepositional phrase (or postpositional phrase, adpositional phrase, etc.) – such phrases usually 
    play an adverbial role in a sentence.

 2. _tudiʔ_ is actually a determiner (like an article) so it indicates that the ancestors are remote
    (in time rather than space in this case), so the phrase _tudiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ_ would mean something 
    like ’those yonder former elders of ours’

 3. the noun phrase _ti syəhub_ is actually the direct object of _ɬuyəhubtubicid_ (as spoken/transcribed),
    or at least not an oblique, which would require a preposition. What I mean with my comments about 
    nominalization was that the referent of the noun phrase, ’story’, is an oblique object of _yəhub_. 
    If you want form a nominal expression of the oblique object of a verb, then you have to use s= to 
    make a gerund (3). Forming a nominal that expresses a non-oblique object or subject can be done with 
    a relative clause (2).


#### My reconstruction of David's earlier comments (8oct19)

 - basic sentence:
    _ɬuyəhubtubicid čəd ti tusyəhub_ (will.tell.you  I this old.story)
 - adding **tux̌ʷəxʷ** means we have to move **čəd**:  &nbsp; čəd-words always come second
     &nbsp; _tux̌ʷəxʷ čəd ɬuyəhubtubicid ti tusyəhub_ (now I will.tell.you this old.story)
 - tusyəhub gets qualified: this old story is that which was (back) then (tuˑdiʔ) of our elders
    &nbsp; _yəhub tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəl_
 - the qualification is included via a prepositional phrase:
   &nbsp; _ʔə tuˑdiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ_  (of that past-nominalized-old-old our)
 - [my unsatisfying rendering of David's comment]: yəhub is intransitive (can have no direct object) so is nominalized 
   and becomes an oblique object of ɬuyəhubtubicid
     &nbsp; _ti s=yəhub_
 - note the dual appearance of the stem **yəhub**:
    * _ɬuyəhubtubicid_: will.recite.causative.you -> will tell you
    * _tusyəhub_:  past.nominalized.recite -> old story

"tuyəcəbtub čəd ʔə tiʔiɬ tudyəl’yəlab":
`
#### Structure
- predicate: *tuyəcəbtub* [past tell-report-inform passive] LD 276
- subject: *čəd*
- possessive prepositional phrase
    - linking particle: *ʔə* [perhaps meaning "of" in this case]
    - object: *tudyəl’yəlab*  [past-my-elder-elder]
    - determiner: *tiʔiɬ*  [that, those]
#### Paul Shannon's reflections
- this line might be strongly attached to the previous line:
   - a story from our distant elders, [one which] I was told by my forbears.
   - *if* so, then 
- yəcəbtub
   - the translation says that *əbtub* is three affixes:
     - *-b*:  LD 32
        - with lexical stem: middle voice 
        - in construction with *-dxʷ- it creates a desiderative stem (not germane here, I don't think)
        - combines with transitive suffixes to form a passive
          construction: *-təb*,  *-du-b*, _**-tu-b**_, *c-əb*, and *-s-əb*
          (this might be the case here)
     - *-txʷ*: var *-tu-* make someone do something; causitive transative suffix
       creating patient-oriented verb stems; pronounced *tu* before *-b* LD 231.
     - *-b*: forms agent-oriented passive verb stems
     - my guess: *əbtub* 
        - tub: inflects *yəc* as a patient-oriented verb, so that with *čəb*: "I was told"
        - *əb* might be just a bridging sound without semantic value
`,

"tu=yəc–b–txʷ–b":
`
- *tu=*: inflectional past prefix; past time, especially the remote past LD 228
- *yəc-*: tell, report, inform LD 276
- *-b*: middle voice, LD 32
     - Middle voice indicates that the subject is the actor and acts upon himself or herself 
       reflexively, for his or her own benefit.  A voice that is neither active nor passive,
       because the subject of the verb cannot be categorized as either agent or patient, having elements of both.
     - be involved in doing something
     - A suffix occuring on several levels of Lushootseed morphology.
       It forms a very large class of agent-oriented intransitive verb
       stems and a number of ambient stems such as *qəl-b* 'rain'.
     - With lexical stems it designates middle voice and in construction
       with *dxʷ(s)-* and *ʔəʷ(s)* it creates a desiderative stem.
     - This *-b* is a component in a number of derivational suffixes
       as well, and combines with transitive suffixes to form a passive
       construction: *-təb*,  *-du-b*, _**-tu-b**_, *c-əb*, and *-s-əb*
- *–txʷ*: external causative (ECS), make someone do something  LD 231 
`,


"tu=d–yəl’–yəlab":
`
- *tu=*: inflectional past prefix; past time, especially the remote past LD 228
- *d-*: first person singular possessive, my.  
        this prefix forms a set with the suffixes *-lap* and *-s*, the prefix *ad-*
        and the predicate particle *cəɬ*.  This set signals possession... LD 76.
- *yəlab*: uncle or aunt of either parent when that parent is deceased; parent; forbearer.
- *yəl’–yəlab*: parents, relatives, ancestors.  reduplication.

"tiʔiɬ bibščəb ʔi tiʔiɬ suʔsuq’ʷaʔs tətyika tiʔiɬ ɬudsyəhubtubicid":
`
#### Structure
- a pair of noun phrases in juxtaposition; Lushootseed almost always predicate-initial
- predicate noun phrase: *tiʔiɬ bibščəb ʔi tiʔiɬ suʔsuq’ʷaʔs tətyika* (mink & tetyika)
- subject noun phrase: *tiʔiɬ ɬudsyəhubtubicid*  (this future telling to you)
#### Discussion

David Beck email (16 nov 19):

You kind of have it backwards—the predicate noun phrase is "*tiʔiɬ bibščəb* …” and the subject phrase
is "*tiʔiɬ ludsyəhubtubicid*". Lushootseed is (almost) always predicate-initial, so when you see a
pair of NPs in juxtaposition like this, the first one is the predicate. You can tell from the
translation because English is the opposite, the subject NP comes first and the predicate NP comes
after “is”.

My notes:

SIL: A predicate is the portion of a clause, excluding the subject, that expresses something about the subject.


Diving in over my head here.

If predication is a somewhat Fregian function, then a simple prototype is

  Socrates is mortal.   # sentence
  isMortal(Socrates)    # predicate structure
  predicate(argument)   # abstract form

Does this abstraction, this pattern, apply also to NP1(NP2)?

  tiʔiɬ bibščəb ʔi tiʔiɬ suʔsuq’ʷaʔs tətyika(tiʔiɬ ɬudsyəhubtubicid)

I suspect I am being too literal about what a predicate can be.

#### wikipedia:

In **traditional grammar**, the predicate is inspired by propositional logic of antiquity (as
opposed to the more modern predicate logic).[a] A predicate is seen as a property that a subject has
or is characterized by. A predicate is therefore an expression that can be true of something.

Most **modern theories of syntax and grammar** take their inspiration for the theory of predicates
from predicate calculus as associated with Gottlob Frege.  This understanding sees predicates as
relations or functions over arguments. The predicate serves either to assign a property to a
singular term argument or to relate two or more arguments to each other. Sentences consist of
predicates and their arguments (and adjuncts) and are thus predicate-argument structures, whereby a
given predicate is seen as linking its arguments into a greater structure.

An adjunct is an optional, or structurally dispensable, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that,
if removed or discarded, will not otherwise affect the remainder of the sentence. Example: In the
sentence John helped Bill in Central Park, the phrase in Central Park is an adjunct.

A more detailed definition of the adjunct emphasizes its attribute as a modifying form, word, or
phrase that depends on another form, word, or phrase, being an element of clause structure with
adverbial function.  An adjunct is not an argument (nor is it a predicative expression), and an
argument is not an adjunct.

    "tux̌ʷəxʷ čəd ɬuyəhubtubicid ti tusyəhub ʔə tuˑdiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ-raw":
`
see David's 1995 [Subjecthood, agency and topicality in Lushootseed](https://twpl.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/twpl/article/download/6305/3293)

čəd-words

David Beck (07oct2019):


The sentence is a variant on _ɬuyəhubtubicid		čəd	ti	syəhub_

adding **tux̌ʷəxʷ** means we have to move **čəd**:  _tux̌ʷəxʷ	čəd	ɬuyəhubtubicid	ti	syəhub_

The structure of the object phrase (the complex bit that takes the place of syəhub) is a bit more complicated. It is
based on the sentence:

yəhub tusluƛ’luƛ’   čəl 
told	   past.elders our
‘our late elders narrated'

but yəhub is an intransitive verb (has no direct object)—that is, to express what is being told you would need to say
something like

yəhub tusluƛ’luƛ’   čəl 	ʔə		ti		syəhub
told	   past.elders our	Prep	spec 	story
’our late elders told a story’

So (hang in there), if you need to form an “noun” from a sentence so that the “noun” refers to something in the sentence
other than a subject or direct object, you need to form something like an English gerund by adding s= to it. So to make
a “noun” referring to the story (an oblique object) in the last sentence I gave you, you would have to do it like this

ti s=yəhub ʔə tusluƛ’luƛ’   čəl 
’what our elders told/narrated’ (lit. ’the telling of our elders’, ʔə acting like the possessive “of” in the literal translation).

What you correctly translate as “this old story of our elders” is more literally ’this past telling of our late elders’
or ‘our late elders's tellings from the past'.

(I can take another shot at explaining the ways “nouns” are formed from clauses if you like, I fear that was as clear as mud.)

BTW, your question prompts me to reconsider the technical gloss of the sentence. If it is correct, then we have a [V N N
N] (a.k.a ditransitive) clause here and that is not supposed to happen. I’ll have to look for more examples of this verb
stem and see if that’s really what is going on or if Hagan dropped an ʔə before ti s=yəhub ʔə tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəl.


me: Or maybe tusyəhub is the object noun, and ʔə tuˑdiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ is one of Thom’s oblique complements?

See above. tusyəhub is an object but ʔə tuˑdiʔ tusluƛ’luƛ’ čəɬ is a possessive phrase expressing what would have been
the subject of the verb yəhub before it got turned into a gerund (a.k.a. nominalized).

me: If something like this is what you would say, could you explain the sense in which čəd is a clitic?  Wikipedia says,
“clitics have the form of affixes, but the distribution of function words.”

What Wikipedia says is correct in spirit but melts into meaningless drivel if you look at it too closely. I would say
that a clitic is a word and so is placed in the sentence according to the rules that put words in linear order, but it
is phonologically weak and so has to “lean" on some other word in the sentence (like n’t in don’t). However, the clitic
isn’t part of the word it leans on like an affix is, and clitics often attach to a range of parts of speech, whereas
affixes tend to attach to only one kind of word. čəd is a clitic in this sense—it can never be said by itself, it can
never have stress, it can lean left or right phonologically, and attaches to adverbs, nouns, verbs, etc., depending on
context.
