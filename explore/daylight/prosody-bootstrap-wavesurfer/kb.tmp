    - mood is a grammatical feature of verbs, used for signaling modality, which in linguistics and philosophyCOMMA
      is the phenomenon whereby language is used to discuss possible situations. For instanceCOMMA a modal 
      expression may convey that something is likelyCOMMA desirableCOMMA or permissible. Quintessential modal expressions:
         - modal auxiliaries such as "could"COMMA "should"COMMA or "must"
	 - modal adverbs such as "possibly" or "necessarily"
	 - modal adjectives such as "conceivable" or "probable".
      HoweverCOMMA modal components have been identified in the meanings of countless natural language expressions 
      including counterfactualsCOMMA propositional attitudesCOMMA evidentialsCOMMA habituals and generics.
